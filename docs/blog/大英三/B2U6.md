??? info "The story of a nation in sandwiches"

    1 Everyone has a favorite sandwich, often prepared according to their specific taste: White or **whole wheat**? Turkey or **ham**? **Grilled** or **toasted**? 
    
    1 每个人都有一款最爱的三明治，通常会依据个人口味来制作，比如外皮用白面包还是全麦面包？是夹火鸡肉还是火腿？烘烤方式是用烤架还是烤箱？
    
    2 We reached out to three food **historians** and asked them to tell the story of a sandwich of their choosing. Together, they show how the sandwiches we eat (or used to eat) do more than ==fill us up during our lunch breaks（午餐时分填饱肚子）==. In their stories are themes of class and gender, of **resourcefulness** and creativity, and of **immigration** and **globalization**. 
    
    2 我们找到了三位食物历史学家，请他们讲述各自喜欢的三明治的故事。他们向我们展示，我们现在（或是以前）食用的三明治不仅仅是午餐时分的果腹品。他们的故事反映了阶层与性别、智慧与创造力、移民与全球化等主题。

    Megan Elias, Boston University
    
    **给职业女性一种家的味道**
    
    梅甘・伊莱亚斯，波士顿大学
    
    3 The **tuna** salad sandwich **originated** from ==an impulse to **conserve**（出于节俭的一时之举）==, only to become a symbol of **excess**. 
    
    3 金枪鱼沙拉三明治最初是出于节俭的一时之举，不料却成了无节制的标志。
    
    4 In the 19th century — before the era of supermarkets and cheap groceries — most Americans avoided wasting food. **Leftovers** of chicken, ham or fish, and some vegetables from supper would be mixed with **mayonnaise** and served on **lettuce** for lunch. 
    
    4 在十九世纪，也就是在超市和廉价食品杂货店的时代来临之前，大多数美国人都会避免食物浪费。晚餐剩下来的鸡肉、火腿、鱼和一些蔬菜会被拌上蛋黄酱，放在生菜叶上充当午餐。
    
    5 Around the end of the 19th century, middle-class women began to spend more time in public, going to department stores, lectures, and museums. Since social **conventions** kept these women out of places where men ate, lunch restaurants opened up to serve these new customers. They offered women exactly the kind of food they had served each other at home: salads. While salads made at home often were made from leftovers, those at lunch restaurants were made from scratch. Fish salads were typical. 
    
    5 十九世纪末，中产阶级女性在公共场所活动的时间更多了：她们去逛百货公司，听讲座，参观博物馆。受社会习俗所限，这些女性不能在男性就餐的场所吃饭，午餐餐厅应运而生，为这些新顾客提供服务。餐厅所提供的食物恰恰就是女性们在家做的沙拉。所不同的是，家里的沙拉通常是用剩菜做的，而午餐餐厅的沙拉则是用新鲜食材制作而成。其中，鱼肉沙拉最具代表性。
    
    6 As further social and economic changes brought more women into public life as office and department store workers, the ladies' lunch became no longer practical, since the office lunchtime was limited. So lunch counters came up with the idea of offering salads between two pieces of bread. This ==sped up table **turnover**（加速了翻桌率）== and ==encouraged customers to get lunch to go（支持外带午餐）==. 
    
    6 随着社会与经济的进一步发展，越来越多的女性进入公共生活，成为办公室和百货公司的员工。由于午餐时间有限，女士们想要优雅从容地享用午餐已不再现实。午餐柜台便想到了用两片面包夹沙拉的主意。这一做法加速了翻桌率，也支持顾客外带午餐。
    
    7 When **canned** tuna was introduced in the early 20th century, lunch counters and home cooks could save the time of cooking a fish and go straight to the salad. But there was a **downside**: The **popularity** of canned tuna led to the growth of a global industry that resulted in the **unintended** killing of millions of dolphins. A clever way to use dinner **scraps** has become a global crisis of **conscience** and **environmentalism**. 
    
    7 二十世纪初，金枪鱼罐头问世，午餐柜台和家庭厨师可以用其直接做沙拉，省去了做鱼的时间。但这也带来了一个问题：金枪鱼罐头的流行促进了一个全球化产业的发展，却无意中导致了数百万海豚被捕杀。一个本是巧用剩饭的举措却引发了全球性的道德危机和生态环境危机。
    
    **A snack for the elites** 
    
    Paul Freedman, Yale University
    
    **精英的“小食”**
    
    保罗・弗里德曼，耶鲁大学
    
    8 Unlike many American food trends of the 1890s, such as the **Waldorf** salad and **chafing dishes**, ==the club sandwich has endured（俱乐部三明治的魅力经久不衰）==. 
    
    8 与美国十九世纪九十年代许多饮食潮流（诸如沃尔多夫沙拉和暖锅）不同，俱乐部三明治的魅力经久不衰。
    
    9 A two-layer affair, the club sandwich calls for three pieces of toasted bread spread with mayonnaise and filled with chicken or turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Usually the sandwich is cut into two **triangles** and held together with a **toothpick** stuck in each half. 
    
    9 俱乐部三明治有两层，用三片涂满蛋黄酱的烤面包夹鸡肉或火鸡肉、培根、生菜和西红柿。通常对半切成两个三角形，用牙签将它们固定。
    
    10 Some believe it should be eaten with a knife and fork and its ==**combination** of **elegance** and mildness（集优雅与清淡（口感）于一体）== makes the club sandwich a **permanent** feature of ==country and city club **cuisine**（乡村和城市俱乐部菜肴）==. 
    
    10 有些人认为俱乐部三明治应该用刀叉食用，它集优雅与清淡于一体，是乡村与城市俱乐部菜肴里一大亘古不变的特色。
    
    11 The club sandwich originated in gentlemen's clubs, which are known — to this day — for a **conservatism** that includes **loyalty** to traditional cuisine. Interestingly, until the 1920s, sandwiches were identified with ladies' lunch places that served "**dainty**" food. 
    
    11 俱乐部三明治发源于绅士俱乐部，那里直到今天都是以保守主义著称的场所，这种保守包含了对传统菜肴的坚守。有趣的是，直到二十世纪二十年代，三明治才进入为女士提供“精巧”食品的午餐厅。
    
    12 Despite the infinite choice of sandwiches today, the club sandwich continues to be popular with hungry people of all backgrounds ==thanks to its inventiveness and appeal（因其创意和魅力）==. 
    
    12 尽管如今三明治种类繁多，俱乐部三明治因其创意和魅力一直以来都是各色食客在饥饿时用以果腹的佳品。

    13 **Chow mein** in a sandwich? Is that a real thing? 
    
    13 炒面夹在三明治里？真有此事？
    
    14 I was first introduced to the chow mein sandwich while completing my **doctorate** at **Brown University**. Even as the child of a Chinatown restaurant owner from Vancouver, I ==viewed the sandwich as something of a **mystery**（觉得三明治是一个谜）==. 
    
    14 第一次见识炒面三明治是我在布朗大学攻读博士学位的时候。虽然身为温哥华中国城餐厅老板的孩子，我仍然觉得这种三明治是一个谜。
    
    15 The chow mein sandwich is ==the typical "East meets West" food（典型的“东西方融合”的食物）==, and it's largely associated with **New England**'s Chinese restaurants — **specifically**, those of Fall River. It's exactly what it sounds like: a sandwich filled with chow mein. It can be served in a **bun** or between sliced white bread, much like a hot turkey sandwich with **gravy**. The **classic** meal includes the sandwich, French fries, and orange juice. 
    
    15 炒面三明治是典型的“东西方融合”的食物，在很大程度上与新英格兰地区的中国餐厅有关——或者更具体地说，与福尔里弗的中国餐厅有关。炒面三明治，顾名思义，就是三明治中夹着炒面。炒面可以放在圆面包里，或是放在切片的白面包中间。它与浇肉汁的热火鸡三明治颇有相似之处。最经典的套餐包括炒面三明治、薯条和橙汁。
    
    16 The sandwich became popular in the 1920s because it was **filling** and cheap. Workers **munched** on chow mein sandwiches in factory **canteens**, while their kids ate them for lunch at schools. They would go on to be available at some "five and **dime**" lunch counters. 
    
    16 这种三明治因为充饥又便宜，在二十世纪二十年代开始流行起来。工人们在工厂餐厅里大口享用炒面三明治，他们的小孩则在学校里以此为午餐。随后，一些廉价品商店的午餐柜台开始售卖它们。
    
    17 For those who grew up in the Fall River area, the chow mein sandwich is ==a reminder of home（一种家的记忆）==. And at one time, Fall River **expats** living in Los Angeles would hold a "Fall River Day." 
    
    17 对于那些在福尔里弗一带长大的人来说，炒面三明治是一种家的记忆。一些居住在洛杉矶的福尔里弗人还一度举办过“福尔里弗日”活动。
    
    18 On the menu? Chow mein sandwiches, of course! 
    
    18 活动菜单上有什么呢？当然有炒面三明治了！

??? info "Taking local on the road"

    1 I ==have a **confession** to make==. Five months into my family's year of **devoted** local eating, I moved out. Not because the hours of canning tomatoes in early August ==drove me insane== or because I was overcome by **insatiable** **cravings** for **tropical** fruits, I just went to college. It was a **challenging** life, getting through chemistry and **calculus** while **adjusting** to a whole new place, and the ==limited dining options== I had as a student ==living on campus（live on/off campus 住校/通校）== made it worse. I suppose I could have tried to grow some vegetables in the college yards or filled my **dorm** room with potted tomato and **zucchini** plants, but then people would really have made fun of me for being from **Appalachia**. Instead, I ate lettuce and **cucumbers** in January just like all the other kids. 
    
    1 我要坦白一件事，有一年，我的家人们热衷于食用本地食物，但我只吃了五个月就搬出了家。我搬出去并不是因为八月初花数小时制作西红柿罐头这件事让我崩溃，也不是因为我抵挡不了对热带水果永无止境的渴望，我的离开是因为求学。大学生活充满了挑战，我一边要适应全新的环境，一边要应付化学和微积分课程，加之我住在学校里，食堂有限的菜品让我的住校生活变得更加糟糕。我想我本可以试着在学校的院子里种些蔬菜或是在我的宿舍里种一些盆栽的西红柿和西葫芦，但如果我这么做的话，别人肯定会嘲笑我是个从阿巴拉契亚地区出来的土包子。最终，我跟其他孩子一样，在一月份吃着生菜和黄瓜。
    
    2 Not ==having fresh produce at my **disposal**== made me realize how good it is. I also noticed that how I think about food is pretty unusual among my peers. When I **perused** the salad bar at my dining hall most evenings, **grimly** surveying the **mealy**, **pinkish** tomatoes and paper-like **iceberg lettuce**, I could pick out what probably came from South America or New Zealand. I always kept this information to myself (because who really cares when there are basketball games and parties to talk about?) but I couldn't help noticing it. 
    
    2 没有新鲜的农产品可吃，让我意识到了它们的珍贵。我也察觉到我对食物的理解和同龄人很不相同。大多数的晚上，当我审视着餐厅里的沙拉吧，沮丧地打量着那些干巴难吃的浅红色的西红柿和像纸一样的卷心莴苣时，我都能大致分辨出哪些来自南美，哪些来自新西兰。对于这一切，我从来都秘而不宣（因为人们在忙着讨论篮球比赛和派对，谁会真正在乎这些呢？），但我还是忍不住留心这件事。
    
    3 I suppose my generation is farther removed from food production than any other. More than our parents, we rely on foods that come out of shiny **wrappers** instead of **peels** or skins. It still surprises a girl like me, who actually lives on a real farm with real animals and stuff growing out of the ground, that so many young adults couldn't guess where their food comes from, or when it's ==in season== where they live. It's not that my rising generation is unintelligent or **unworldly** — my classmates are some of the smartest, most **cultured** people I know. But information about food and farming is not readily available. Most of the people I know have never seen a working farm or had any reason to do so. Living among people my age from various cities across the United States made me realize that I actually know a lot about food production, and I don't take this **realization** for **granted**. 
    
    3 我想我这一代人与食品生产的距离比之前任何一代人都要远。比起我们的父母，我们更依赖闪亮的包装纸里包着的食物，而不是那些需要用手剥壳去皮的食物。但让一个像我这样生活在农场里、见过活的动物和长在地里的庄稼的女孩仍然感到惊讶的是，那么多年轻人不知道他们的食物从何而来，也不知道在他们生活的那个地方每个季节有什么时令果蔬。这当然不是因为我们年轻的这一代不聪明或是不谙世事——我的同学是我认识的最聪明、最有素养的一些人，而是因为与食物和耕作相关的信息不易获取。我认识的大多数人从来没见过也没想过要去了解真正的农场。置身于来自美国五湖四海的同龄人中间，我意识到我其实拥有大量食品生产的知识，而意识到这一点并非偶然。
    
    4 I also won't forget to appreciate how much better local food tastes. Next to getting a good night's sleep on a comfortable bed, cooking good food became my main **motivation** for coming home from school to visit. Of course seeing my family was nice, but **priorities** are priorities, right? It was great after weeks of dorm life to eat eggs with deep **golden** **yolks**, and greens that still had their flavor and **crunch**. I loved being able to look at a table full of food and know where every vegetable was grown. 
    
    4 我同样不会忘记赞美一下本地食物，它们美味得多了。除了能在舒适的床上睡个好觉外，烹饪美食也是我回家的主要动力。当然，见到家人是美好的，但首要任务始终是首要任务，对吧？在数周的宿舍生活后吃到有金色蛋黄的鸡蛋以及原汁原味、脆爽劲十足的绿色蔬菜真是太棒了。看着一大桌子食物，知道每种蔬菜从何而来，这种感觉我实在是太喜欢了。
    
    5 During my first year of college I found two campus canteens that use ==**organic**, locally grown produce（本地种植的有机农产品）== in their meals, and one that consistently uses ==**free-range** meat（放养猪的猪肉）==. For the most part, these vendors did not widely advertise the fact that they were **participating** in the ==local food economy==. I only found out because I cared, and then tried to buy most of my food from those places. 
    
    5 在我上大学的头一年，我在学校里发现了两家使用本地种植的有机农产品来制作食物的餐厅，还有一家餐厅使用的一直是放养动物的肉。通常，这些店家并不四处宣传他们参与促进本地食品经济这一事实。我之所以能发现，是因为我关心食品生产。在那之后，大多数食物我都会在这些地方购买。
    
    6 My generation, I know, has the reputation of sticking **earbuds** in our ears and not caring about what might happen in 10 years, or even next week. But we do care about a lot of things, including what we eat. Food is something real. Living on the land that has grown my food gives me a sense of security which I feel lucky to have. Feeling safe isn't so easy for people my age, who face horrible threats like global warming, overpopulation, and chemical abuse. But even as the world runs out of fuel and the ice caps **melt**, I will know the real sources of my **sustenance**. My college education may or may not ==land me a good job== down the road, but my farm education will definitely ==have a **profound** and **far-reaching** influence on== me. The choices I make now about my food will influence the rest of my life. If a lot of us felt this way and started thinking carefully about our consumption habits just one meal at a time, we could affect the future of our planet. No matter how **grave** the **predictions** I hear about the future, for my peers and me, that's a fact that gives me hope. 
    
    6 我知道，我们一直被认为是耳朵里塞着耳机、对十年甚至未来一周之后可能会发生的事不闻不问的一代人。但事实上，我们对很多事都很关心，包括我们吃的食物。食物是真实的存在。生活在种植了我的食物的土地上给我一种安全感，我很幸运能拥有这种安全感。面临着诸如全球变暖、人口过剩和滥用化学物品这样的可怕威胁，能拥有安全感对我这个年纪的人来说并不容易。但是，即使世界燃料耗尽，冰盖融化，我依然知道我赖以生存的食物从何而来。我所接受的高等教育也许能带给我一份好工作，也许不能，但我在农场受到的熏陶一定会对我产生深远的影响。我现在作出的食物选择将影响我的余生。如果我们很多人都能意识到这一点，并开始认真思考我们的消费习惯，哪怕只是某次吃饭时想一想，都可能改变我们整个星球的未来。无论我听到的对未来的预测有多么严峻，对我和我的同龄人来说，那是一个能给我带来希望的事实。
