??? info "Travel in Europe"

    1 I had a strong desire to **roam**. I wanted to wander through Europe. I did make the trip. 
    
    1 我有种强烈的愿望想去四处游荡。我想走遍欧洲。我的确做到了。
    
    2 One of the small marvels of my first trip to Europe was the discovery that the world could be so full of variety, that there were so many different ways of doing essentially the same things, like eating and drinking, and buying cinema tickets. 
    
    2 我的首次欧洲之旅带给我很多小惊奇，其中之一就是我发现世界竟是如此丰富多彩，本质上相同的事处理起来却方式各异，比如吃喝或买电影票。
    
    3 I remember on my first trip to Europe going alone to a movie in **Copenhagen**. In **Denmark** you are given a ticket for ==an assigned seat（指定的座位）==. I went into the cinema and discovered that my ticket directed me to sit beside the only other people in the place, a young couple locked in the sort of ==**passionate** embrace（激情的拥抱）== associated with ==**dockside** **reunions**（码头重逢）== at the end of long wars. I could no more have sat beside them than I could have asked to join in, so I took a place a few seats away. 
    
    3 记得第一次去欧洲旅行的时候，我在哥本哈根独自一人去看电影。在丹麦，买的电影票上有指定的座位号。我走进电影院，发现在我的票对应的座位旁，只有一对年轻情侣。这对情侣如胶似漆地拥抱在一起，让人联想到旷日持久的战争结束后人们在码头上重聚的情景。我感觉坐在他们边上就如同要求加入他们一样让我尴尬，因此，我选择隔了几个座位坐了下来。
    
    4 People came in, consulted their tickets and filled the seats around us. By the time the film started there were about 30 of us sitting close together in the middle of a vast and otherwise empty cinema. Two minutes into the movie, a woman ==made her way（make one's way to ... 艰难地向前走）== with difficulty down my row, stopped beside my seat, and told me ==in a **stern** voice（用严厉的口吻说）== that I was in her place. This caused **fretful** re-examining of tickets by everyone nearby until ==word got around that（人们议论纷纷）== I was an American tourist and therefore unable to ==follow simple seating instructions（遵循就坐指示）==. Finally, I was directed in some shame back to my assigned place. So 30 of us crowded together like **refugees** in ==an **overloaded** **lifeboat**（超载的救生艇）==. It occurred to me then that there are certain things that some nations do better than everyone else and certain things that they do far worse. 
    
    4 人们陆续地走进影院，对照电影票找到位子，在我们周围坐了下来。电影开场时，在宽敞空旷的观众席的中间，扎堆地坐了约30人。电影开场两分钟后，一位女士艰难地挤到我这排，在我座位旁停下，用严厉的口吻告诉我，我坐了她的位子。这让周围的每一个人都开始不安地重新确认自己票上的座位号，直到人群中纷纷议论说我是一个美国游客，因此没能遵循简单的就座指示。最后，我带着一丝羞愧被指引着回到指定的位子。接着，我们30人如同一艘超载的救生船上的难民一般挤作一团继续观看电影。那时我想，有些国家在某些事情上做得比任何其他国家都好，然而在另外一些事情上，他们却做得糟糕许多。
    
    5 Sometimes a nation's little inventions are so **singular** and clever that we associate them with that country alone — ==**double-decker** buses（双层巴士）== in Britain, **windmills** in **the Netherlands**, ==**sidewalk** cafés（路边咖啡馆）== in Paris. And yet there are some things that most countries do without difficulty while others cannot ==get a **grasp** of（掌握要领）== them at all. 
    
    5 有时候，一个国家的小发明是如此独特、巧妙，以至于我们总是由它而联想到那个国家，比如英国的双层巴士、荷兰的风车，还有巴黎人行道上的咖啡馆。然而，也有一些大部分国家不费吹灰之力就能办到的事情，有些国家却完全无法领会。
    
    6 The French, for instance, cannot get the hang of **queuing**. They try and try, but it is beyond them. **Wherever** you go in Paris, you see **orderly** lines waiting at bus stops, but as soon as the bus pulls up, everyone **scrambles** to be the first **aboard**, quite unaware that this defeats the whole purpose of queuing. 
    
    6 比如，法国人就无法掌握排队的窍门。他们一遍遍地尝试，但这似乎超出了他们的能力范围。无论你去巴黎的什么地方，都会看到整齐的队伍在公交车站排队候车。但公交车一到站，每个人都争先恐后地抢着第一个上车，完全没有意识到，这样一来，他们排队的意义荡然无存。
    
    7 The British, on the other hand, do not understand certain of the fundamentals of eating, as evidenced by their instinct to eat hamburgers with a knife and fork. To my continuing amazement, many of them also turn their fork **upside down** and balance the food on the back of it. I've lived in England for over a decade and I still have to fight an **impulse** to go up to strangers ==in pubs and restaurants（酒吧和餐馆）== and say, "Excuse me, can I give you a tip that'll help stop those peas **bouncing** all over the table?" 
    
    7 另一方面，英国人无法领略吃的一些基本要领，证据就是他们吃汉堡时本能地会使用刀叉。令我一直感到惊讶的是，很多英国人还把叉子反面朝上放，把食物放在叉子背面保持平衡。我在英国生活了十几年，但在酒吧和餐馆里，我还不得不压制这样的冲动——走上前对那些陌生人说：“打扰了。可以允许我告诉你一个小技巧吗？这样就不会把豆子散落在整张桌子上了。”
    
    8 Germans may be confused by **humour**, the **Swiss** seem to have no concept of fun, and the **Spanish** think there is nothing unusual about eating dinner at midnight. 
    
    8 德国人可能会对幽默感到困扰，瑞士人好像对乐趣毫无概念，西班牙人丝毫不觉得在半夜吃晚饭有什么不同寻常。
    
    9 Yes, there are many differences among Europeans, and language is one of them. 
    
    9 是的，欧洲人是如此不同，语言是差异之一。
    
    10 When I told friends in London that I was going to travel around Europe and write a book about it, they said, "Oh, you must speak a lot of languages." 
    
    10 当我告诉伦敦的朋友，我将周游欧洲各地并要把旅行经历写成书时，他们说∶“哦，你肯定会说很多种语言吧。”
    
    11 "Why, no," I would reply with a certain pride, "only English," and they would look at me as if I were crazy. But that's the great thing of foreign travel, as far as I am concerned. I can't think of anything that ==**excites** a greater sense of **childlike** wonder（激起一种孩子般的好奇心）== than to be in a country where you ==are **ignorant** of（一无所知）== almost everything. Suddenly you are five years old again. You can't read anything; you have only the most fundamental sense of how things work; you can't even **reliably** cross a street without **endangering** your life. Your whole **existence** becomes a series of interesting guesses. 
    
    11 “嗨，我不会！”我会带着一点骄傲回答，“我只会英语。”然后他们就看着我，好像我疯了。但是，就我而言，那正是国外旅游的美妙之处。我想没有什么比置身于一个几乎一无所知的国家更能激发一种孩子般的好奇心。突然之间，你又回到了五岁。你无法读懂任何东西，你对事物的运行方式只有最基本的感知，你甚至无法安全地穿过马路。你的整个存在变成了一系列有趣的猜想。
    
    12 In my hotel in Oslo, the **chambermaid** each morning left me a **packet** of something called *Bio Tex Blå*, a "*minipakke for ferie, hybel og weekend*", according to the instructions. I spent many happy hours **sniffing** it and experimenting with it, uncertain whether it was for washing out clothes, or cleaning the toilet bowl. In the end I decided it was for washing out clothes, but for the rest of the week everywhere I went in **Oslo** I heard people saying to each other, "You know, that man smelled like ==toilet-bowl cleaner（马桶清洁剂）==." 
    
    12 在我所住的奥斯陆的宾馆里，女服务员每天早上都留给我一盒叫作Bio Tex Blå的东西，用法说明上说它是一种minipakke for ferie，hybel og weekend。我乐呵呵地花了好几个小时，闻它的气味，试验各种可能的用法，还是不清楚它到底是用来洗衣服的，还是用来清洗抽水马桶的。最后，我判定它是用来洗衣服的。结果，在奥斯陆余下的几天里，无论我走到哪儿，都听见有人互相议论∶“你知道吗？那个人身上有马桶清洁剂的味道。”
    
    13 However, I wanted to be **puzzled** and **charmed**, to experience the endless variety of a continent where you can board a train and an hour later be somewhere where people speak a different language, eat different foods, work different hours, live lives that are at once so different and yet so oddly similar. I wanted to be a tourist. 
    
    13 然而，无论是困惑不解，还是陶醉着迷，我都想体验一下，我想体验一个大洲的千差万别——你坐上列车，一个小时以后，你所到达的地方，人们语言不同，饮食各异，有不同的工作时间，生活陡然间变得如此不同，但又惊人地相似。我希望做一个旅行者。

??? info "The secret to remembering travel"

    1 Whenever I look through all those files of things I've saved over the years, I usually stumble upon some long-forgotten newspaper article I have **tucked** away. I ==give it a **casual** glance（漫不经心地看了一眼（马虎，不仔细）==, turn it over, then always find that whatever's on the back is more interesting. ==**Serendipity** seems to win out over planning（机缘巧合胜过精心计划）== every time. Travel is like that. No matter how many journals I fill, photos I take, or posts I send, I find that I often "document" the wrong things. 
    
    1 每当我翻阅这些年来收藏的一叠叠东西时，我常会无意间看到某篇报纸文章，当时随手一塞，早已经遗忘。我漫不经心地看它一眼，又把报纸翻过来，然后发现写在背面的东西总显得更为有趣。机缘巧合似乎总胜过精心计划。旅行也是这样。无论我写了多少旅行日志，拍摄多少照片，发送多少帖子，我发现自己经常记录了错误的事情。
    
    2 While living and teaching English in **Vietnam** in the late 1990s, I filled my journal with reviews of the Western movies I **devoured** ==in between classes（在课间）==. Unfortunately, not one word described life in the alleys in **Ho Chi Minh City**, a place ==in the **throes** of（处于……艰难时期）== ==wild **transition**（激烈的变革）==. 
    
    2 二十世纪九十年代末我在越南生活和教授英语，我在上课间隙津津有味地观看西方电影，在日记中写满了电影评论。遗憾的是，日记中没有一个词描述胡志明市街头巷尾的生活，而那时，这个城市正处于艰难又激烈的变革中。
    
    3 Similarly, while studying in **Russia** in the early 1990s, I snapped roll after roll of onion-domed **cathedrals** that haven't changed for centuries, ignoring the **babushkas** holding **toothbrushes** for sale outside **metro** exits — ==a **telling** **snapshot** of（……的生动写照）== the country's first ==baby steps into **capitalism**（起步迈向（资本主义））==, now long gone. 
    
    3 同样，九十年代初在俄罗斯学习时，我对着几个世纪不变的洋葱形圆顶大教堂拍了一卷又一卷的胶片，而对在地铁口外举着牙刷售卖的俄罗斯老奶奶视而不见，这正是这个国家起步迈向资本主义的生动写照，而现在都已经不复存在了。
    
    4 Not that there's anything wrong with gold-topped churches, of course, but I ended up "capturing" the same Russia people can capture today. Now, when I go on trips, I try to listen to what Future Robert is trying to tell Present Robert to notice, to record, to remember. 
    
    4 当然，拍摄金顶教堂并没有什么错，但结果就是我所拍摄的俄罗斯与今天人们看到的俄罗斯并无二致。所以当我现在出去旅行时，我试着听听未来的罗伯特想要告诉现在的罗伯特需要注意什么，记录什么和记住什么。
    
    5 This isn't as easy as it sounds, but it's worth bringing up since most of us tend to over-document when we travel these days. ==Armed with smartphones and **virtually** limitless memory cards（配备（智能手机和近乎无限容量的存储卡））==, we take hundreds if not thousands of photos ==without a second thought（毫不犹豫）==. And unlike before, we actually share them — immediately — on social media. 
    
    5 这并不像听起来那么容易，但值得提出，因为当下我们大多数人在旅行时往往会过度记录。配备智能手机和近乎无限容量的存储卡，我们可以毫不犹豫地拍摄数百甚至数千张照片。与以前不同的是，我们还会立即在社交媒体上分享这些照片。
    
    6 That would be fine, but I frequently catch myself rushing like a Black Friday shopper to spread news of my travels ==in real time（实时）==. Last week in eastern **Oregon**, I jumped out of the car at the **Clarno Unit** of the **John Day Fossil Beds National Monument**, snapped a photo, touched it up, and sent it off. This is all before I even bothered to ==take a non-virtual look at（真真切切地用肉眼去看）== the **fossilized** land plants and animals in the 44-million-year-old **volcanic** **mudflow**. 
    
    6 这当然也可以，但我经常发现自己像黑色星期五购物者一样急急忙忙地实时传播我的旅行讯息。上周在俄勒冈州东部，我在约翰迪化石层国家遗址的克拉诺区跳下车，快速拍了一张照片，修了图，然后就把照片上传了。做完这些前，我甚至都没实实在在地看一看这些四千四百万年前火山泥流中的陆地植物和动物化石。
    
    7 ==The **antidote** to the nod-and-go approach（应对（对抗）（点头就走的做法）办法）== is simple: just slow down. This isn't a unique observation, or even a new one. When **photography** was just ==getting off the ground（顺利开始（开启））== in the **Victorian** era, English art **critic** **John Ruskin** criticized how travelers ended up paying less attention when they had a camera in their hand. His advice was to **sketch**, reasoning that ==taking the time to **jot** down（最大限度地保留记忆）== even the simplest drawings can help anyone "see" a place better. 
    
    7 要改变这种蜻蜓点水式的游览方式，办法其实很简单：只是放慢速度。这并非独到的观点，也并不新颖。维多利亚时代，当摄影刚刚起步时，英国艺术评论家约翰・罗斯金就批评说，游客手上拿了相机以后对周围的注意力反而降低了。他给出的建议是画素描。他认为花点时间随手画下即便是最简单的几笔也能够帮助人们更好地了解一个地方。
    
    8 That point is certainly **echoed** by many other people. In a newly published book on sketching, the author illustrates how a few **thoughtful** drawings can do a good job of capturing the spirit of an experience. He believes that "sketching uses more of your brain's **capabilities** … creating a more detailed, **layered** map," and I agree with him. 
    
    8 这个观点得到了许多人的响应。在一本新出版的关于素描的书中，作者阐释了具有思想性的图画如何能够很好地表达体验感受的精髓。他认为“素描会调动你大脑的更多功能······创建一幅更为详细、更有层次的图谱”。我赞同他的观点。
    
    9 The key to ==**maximizing** future memories（最大限度地保留记忆）==, then, is just to be present, pay attention to the details that interest you, and ==look at them **closely**（仔细看）== — perhaps even sketch them. Only you know what those details are. 
    
    9 因此，要想最大限度地增强未来记忆，关键就是要亲历体验，关注你感兴趣的细节，仔细观察它们——也许甚至勾勒它们。只有你知道那些细节是什么。
    
    10 Most people take photos when they travel, but not everyone jots down drawings and descriptions in a journal. I've filled 30-some notebooks with a decade's worth of lost travel moments. Lately I've been reading each of them, page by page. It's been amazing. I enjoy the **unfiltered** lines: scribbles about train times, sketches of a bus driver's dramatic **mustache**, ideas for songs I'll never write. These **musings** can ==bring back forgotten memories（唤醒被遗忘的记忆）== and lend color to **cherished** ones. 
    
    10 大多数人在旅行时都会拍照，但并不是每个人都会以图画和文字来记日志。我有大约30个笔记本，里面填满了十年的旅行片段。最近我一直在一页一页地翻看笔记。这真是太有意思了。我喜欢那些未经修饰的内容：字迹潦草的火车时刻，公交司机滑稽小胡子的素描，还有永远不会写的歌曲的灵感。这些思考可以唤醒被遗忘的记忆，并为那些珍贵的记忆增添色彩。
    
    11 I've been telling friends the story about a "**goat** **whisperer**" I encountered on a train in **Bulgaria** for years, but when I sat down to write about it a few months back, I was able to paint the picture more clearly because I had thought to record how the gray-haired man **tapped** his foot as he whispered, that the baby goat was wrapped **snugly** in a blue-and-red **striped** plastic bag, and how it happened en route to **Vidin** on what would have been my dad's 65th birthday. 
    
    11 多年来，我一直给朋友们讲我在保加利亚的列车上遇到的一个“山羊语者”的故事。但当我几个月前坐下来想把它写出来时，我能更加清楚地描绘这幅画面，因为我曾试图记录下这些：那个灰白头发的男人如何一边轻轻踏着脚，一边低声耳语；一只小山羊被温暖舒适地裹在一个蓝红色条纹的塑料袋里；事情如何发生在去维丁的途中，而那一天本该是我父亲65岁的生日。
    
    12 I like to think that each trip has at least one "moment" like this — one that teaches us a lasting lesson or influences how we see the world. Such moments can't be planned, of course, but I try to be present enough to know when one might be happening so I don't just slow down to enjoy it; I stop altogether. 
    
    12 我觉得每次旅行都至少有一个这样的“时刻”——它给予我们深刻的启示或影响我们的世界观。当然，这样的时刻无法提前计划，但我努力去亲历体验，以便在它们可能发生时能够感知，那时我不仅仅是放慢脚步去感受它，我驻足停留。
    
    13 Last October, I traveled to south-central France to ==follow in the footsteps（追随……的脚步）== **Robert Louis Stevenson** took in his book *Travels with a Donkey in the **Cévennes***. When I came to a small lake between the villages of **Le Cheylard** and **Luc**, I knew I was near the spot where Stevenson had offered what would become one of the book's **enduring** **quotations**: "I ==travel for travel's **sake**（为了旅行而旅行）==. The great affair is to move."
    
    13 去年十月，我随着罗伯特・路易・史蒂文森在《塞文山驴伴之旅》中的脚步前往法国中南部。当我来到勒谢拉尔和吕克村庄之间的一个小湖泊时，我知道我走近了史蒂文森到过的地方，在这里他写下了这本书经久不衰的名言之一：“我为旅行而旅行。重要的是步履不停”。 
    
    14 And I **disobeyed** him. I stopped instead — to look and listen. Only then did I hear a few pieces of dry leaves falling through the trees and birds stopping their songs then starting up again. Only then did I notice the **spiky** **chestnut** **shells** below my feet and the **birch** trees **swaying** in the wind — details Stevenson had noted, too. 
    
    14 我没有听从他的话。我停了下来——去细看去倾听。直到那时，我才听到几片干枯的树叶从树上掉下来，鸟儿停止了歌声，然后又开始歌唱。直到那时，我才注意到脚下带刺的栗子壳，以及风中摇曳的桦树——那些史蒂文森书中也提及的细节。
    
    15 I didn't photograph or post any of that, but I sure do remember it. 
    
    15 我没有拍照，也没有发帖，但我确实记住了。
