??? info "Travel in Europe"

    1 I had a strong desire to **roam**. I wanted to wander through Europe. I did make the trip. 
    
    1 我有种强烈的愿望想去四处游荡。我想走遍欧洲。我的确做到了。
    
    2 One of the small marvels of my first trip to Europe was the discovery that the world could be so full of variety, that there were so many different ways of doing essentially the same things, like eating and drinking, and buying cinema tickets. 
    
    2 我的首次欧洲之旅带给我很多小惊奇，其中之一就是我发现世界竟是如此丰富多彩，本质上相同的事处理起来却方式各异，比如吃喝或买电影票。
    
    3 I remember on my first trip to Europe going alone to a movie in **Copenhagen**. In **Denmark** you are given a ticket for ==an assigned seat（指定的座位）==. I went into the cinema and discovered that my ticket directed me to sit beside the only other people in the place, a young couple locked in the sort of ==**passionate** embrace（激情的拥抱）== associated with ==**dockside** **reunions**（码头重逢）== at the end of long wars. I could no more have sat beside them than I could have asked to join in, so I took a place a few seats away. 
    
    3 记得第一次去欧洲旅行的时候，我在哥本哈根独自一人去看电影。在丹麦，买的电影票上有指定的座位号。我走进电影院，发现在我的票对应的座位旁，只有一对年轻情侣。这对情侣如胶似漆地拥抱在一起，让人联想到旷日持久的战争结束后人们在码头上重聚的情景。我感觉坐在他们边上就如同要求加入他们一样让我尴尬，因此，我选择隔了几个座位坐了下来。
    
    4 People came in, consulted their tickets and filled the seats around us. By the time the film started there were about 30 of us sitting close together in the middle of a vast and otherwise empty cinema. Two minutes into the movie, a woman ==made her way（make one's way to ... 艰难地向前走）== with difficulty down my row, stopped beside my seat, and told me ==in a **stern** voice（用严厉的口吻说）== that I was in her place. This caused **fretful** re-examining of tickets by everyone nearby until ==word got around that（人们议论纷纷）== I was an American tourist and therefore unable to ==follow simple seating instructions（遵循就坐指示）==. Finally, I was directed in some shame back to my assigned place. So 30 of us crowded together like **refugees** in ==an **overloaded** **lifeboat**（超载的救生艇）==. It occurred to me then that there are certain things that some nations do better than everyone else and certain things that they do far worse. 
    
    4 人们陆续地走进影院，对照电影票找到位子，在我们周围坐了下来。电影开场时，在宽敞空旷的观众席的中间，扎堆地坐了约30人。电影开场两分钟后，一位女士艰难地挤到我这排，在我座位旁停下，用严厉的口吻告诉我，我坐了她的位子。这让周围的每一个人都开始不安地重新确认自己票上的座位号，直到人群中纷纷议论说我是一个美国游客，因此没能遵循简单的就座指示。最后，我带着一丝羞愧被指引着回到指定的位子。接着，我们30人如同一艘超载的救生船上的难民一般挤作一团继续观看电影。那时我想，有些国家在某些事情上做得比任何其他国家都好，然而在另外一些事情上，他们却做得糟糕许多。
    
    5 Sometimes a nation's little inventions are so **singular** and clever that we associate them with that country alone — ==**double-decker** buses（双层巴士）== in Britain, **windmills** in **the Netherlands**, ==**sidewalk** cafés（路边咖啡馆）== in Paris. And yet there are some things that most countries do without difficulty while others cannot ==get a **grasp** of（掌握要领）== them at all. 
    
    5 有时候，一个国家的小发明是如此独特、巧妙，以至于我们总是由它而联想到那个国家，比如英国的双层巴士、荷兰的风车，还有巴黎人行道上的咖啡馆。然而，也有一些大部分国家不费吹灰之力就能办到的事情，有些国家却完全无法领会。
    
    6 The French, for instance, cannot get the hang of **queuing**. They try and try, but it is beyond them. **Wherever** you go in Paris, you see **orderly** lines waiting at bus stops, but as soon as the bus pulls up, everyone **scrambles** to be the first **aboard**, quite unaware that this defeats the whole purpose of queuing. 
    
    6 比如，法国人就无法掌握排队的窍门。他们一遍遍地尝试，但这似乎超出了他们的能力范围。无论你去巴黎的什么地方，都会看到整齐的队伍在公交车站排队候车。但公交车一到站，每个人都争先恐后地抢着第一个上车，完全没有意识到，这样一来，他们排队的意义荡然无存。
    
    7 The British, on the other hand, do not understand certain of the fundamentals of eating, as evidenced by their instinct to eat hamburgers with a knife and fork. To my continuing amazement, many of them also turn their fork **upside down** and balance the food on the back of it. I've lived in England for over a decade and I still have to fight an **impulse** to go up to strangers ==in pubs and restaurants（酒吧和餐馆）== and say, "Excuse me, can I give you a tip that'll help stop those peas **bouncing** all over the table?" 
    
    7 另一方面，英国人无法领略吃的一些基本要领，证据就是他们吃汉堡时本能地会使用刀叉。令我一直感到惊讶的是，很多英国人还把叉子反面朝上放，把食物放在叉子背面保持平衡。我在英国生活了十几年，但在酒吧和餐馆里，我还不得不压制这样的冲动——走上前对那些陌生人说：“打扰了。可以允许我告诉你一个小技巧吗？这样就不会把豆子散落在整张桌子上了。”
    
    8 Germans may be confused by **humour**, the **Swiss** seem to have no concept of fun, and the **Spanish** think there is nothing unusual about eating dinner at midnight. 
    
    8 德国人可能会对幽默感到困扰，瑞士人好像对乐趣毫无概念，西班牙人丝毫不觉得在半夜吃晚饭有什么不同寻常。
    
    9 Yes, there are many differences among Europeans, and language is one of them. 
    
    9 是的，欧洲人是如此不同，语言是差异之一。
    
    10 When I told friends in London that I was going to travel around Europe and write a book about it, they said, "Oh, you must speak a lot of languages." 
    
    10 当我告诉伦敦的朋友，我将周游欧洲各地并要把旅行经历写成书时，他们说∶“哦，你肯定会说很多种语言吧。”
    
    11 "Why, no," I would reply with a certain pride, "only English," and they would look at me as if I were crazy. But that's the great thing of foreign travel, as far as I am concerned. I can't think of anything that ==**excites** a greater sense of **childlike** wonder（激起一种孩子般的好奇心）== than to be in a country where you ==are **ignorant** of（一无所知）== almost everything. Suddenly you are five years old again. You can't read anything; you have only the most fundamental sense of how things work; you can't even **reliably** cross a street without **endangering** your life. Your whole **existence** becomes a series of interesting guesses. 
    
    11 “嗨，我不会！”我会带着一点骄傲回答，“我只会英语。”然后他们就看着我，好像我疯了。但是，就我而言，那正是国外旅游的美妙之处。我想没有什么比置身于一个几乎一无所知的国家更能激发一种孩子般的好奇心。突然之间，你又回到了五岁。你无法读懂任何东西，你对事物的运行方式只有最基本的感知，你甚至无法安全地穿过马路。你的整个存在变成了一系列有趣的猜想。
    
    12 In my hotel in Oslo, the **chambermaid** each morning left me a **packet** of something called *Bio Tex Blå*, a "*minipakke for ferie, hybel og weekend*", according to the instructions. I spent many happy hours **sniffing** it and experimenting with it, uncertain whether it was for washing out clothes, or cleaning the toilet bowl. In the end I decided it was for washing out clothes, but for the rest of the week everywhere I went in **Oslo** I heard people saying to each other, "You know, that man smelled like ==toilet-bowl cleaner（马桶清洁剂）==." 
    
    12 在我所住的奥斯陆的宾馆里，女服务员每天早上都留给我一盒叫作Bio Tex Blå的东西，用法说明上说它是一种minipakke for ferie，hybel og weekend。我乐呵呵地花了好几个小时，闻它的气味，试验各种可能的用法，还是不清楚它到底是用来洗衣服的，还是用来清洗抽水马桶的。最后，我判定它是用来洗衣服的。结果，在奥斯陆余下的几天里，无论我走到哪儿，都听见有人互相议论∶“你知道吗？那个人身上有马桶清洁剂的味道。”
    
    13 However, I wanted to be **puzzled** and **charmed**, to experience the endless variety of a continent where you can board a train and an hour later be somewhere where people speak a different language, eat different foods, work different hours, live lives that are at once so different and yet so oddly similar. I wanted to be a tourist. 
    
    13 然而，无论是困惑不解，还是陶醉着迷，我都想体验一下，我想体验一个大洲的千差万别——你坐上列车，一个小时以后，你所到达的地方，人们语言不同，饮食各异，有不同的工作时间，生活陡然间变得如此不同，但又惊人地相似。我希望做一个旅行者。

??? info "The secret to remembering travel"

    1 Whenever I look through all those files of things I've saved over the years, I usually stumble upon some long-forgotten newspaper article I have **tucked** away. I ==give it a **casual** glance（漫不经心地看了一眼（马虎，不仔细）==, turn it over, then always find that whatever's on the back is more interesting. ==**Serendipity** seems to win out over planning（机缘巧合胜过精心计划）== every time. Travel is like that. No matter how many journals I fill, photos I take, or posts I send, I find that I often "document" the wrong things. 
    
    1 每当我翻阅这些年来收藏的一叠叠东西时，我常会无意间看到某篇报纸文章，当时随手一塞，早已经遗忘。我漫不经心地看它一眼，又把报纸翻过来，然后发现写在背面的东西总显得更为有趣。机缘巧合似乎总胜过精心计划。旅行也是这样。无论我写了多少旅行日志，拍摄多少照片，发送多少帖子，我发现自己经常记录了错误的事情。
    
    2 While living and teaching English in **Vietnam** in the late 1990s, I filled my journal with reviews of the Western movies I **devoured** ==in between classes（在课间）==. Unfortunately, not one word described life in the alleys in **Ho Chi Minh City**, a place ==in the **throes** of（处于……艰难时期）== ==wild **transition**（激烈的变革）==. 
    
    2 二十世纪九十年代末我在越南生活和教授英语，我在上课间隙津津有味地观看西方电影，在日记中写满了电影评论。遗憾的是，日记中没有一个词描述胡志明市街头巷尾的生活，而那时，这个城市正处于艰难又激烈的变革中。
    
    3 Similarly, while studying in **Russia** in the early 1990s, I snapped roll after roll of onion-domed **cathedrals** that haven't changed for centuries, ignoring the **babushkas** holding **toothbrushes** for sale outside **metro** exits — ==a **telling** **snapshot** of（……的生动写照）== the country's first ==baby steps into **capitalism**（起步迈向（资本主义））==, now long gone. 
    
    3 同样，九十年代初在俄罗斯学习时，我对着几个世纪不变的洋葱形圆顶大教堂拍了一卷又一卷的胶片，而对在地铁口外举着牙刷售卖的俄罗斯老奶奶视而不见，这正是这个国家起步迈向资本主义的生动写照，而现在都已经不复存在了。
    
    4 Not that there's anything wrong with gold-topped churches, of course, but I ended up "capturing" the same Russia people can capture today. Now, when I go on trips, I try to listen to what Future Robert is trying to tell Present Robert to notice, to record, to remember. 
    
    4 当然，拍摄金顶教堂并没有什么错，但结果就是我所拍摄的俄罗斯与今天人们看到的俄罗斯并无二致。所以当我现在出去旅行时，我试着听听未来的罗伯特想要告诉现在的罗伯特需要注意什么，记录什么和记住什么。
    
    5 This isn't as easy as it sounds, but it's worth bringing up since most of us tend to over-document when we travel these days. ==Armed with smartphones and **virtually** limitless memory cards（配备（智能手机和近乎无限容量的存储卡））==, we take hundreds if not thousands of photos ==without a second thought（毫不犹豫）==. And unlike before, we actually share them — immediately — on social media. 
    
    5 这并不像听起来那么容易，但值得提出，因为当下我们大多数人在旅行时往往会过度记录。配备智能手机和近乎无限容量的存储卡，我们可以毫不犹豫地拍摄数百甚至数千张照片。与以前不同的是，我们还会立即在社交媒体上分享这些照片。
    
    6 That would be fine, but I frequently catch myself rushing like a Black Friday shopper to spread news of my travels ==in real time（实时）==. Last week in eastern **Oregon**, I jumped out of the car at the **Clarno Unit** of the **John Day Fossil Beds National Monument**, snapped a photo, touched it up, and sent it off. This is all before I even bothered to ==take a non-virtual look at（真真切切地用肉眼去看）== the **fossilized** land plants and animals in the 44-million-year-old **volcanic** **mudflow**. 
    
    6 这当然也可以，但我经常发现自己像黑色星期五购物者一样急急忙忙地实时传播我的旅行讯息。上周在俄勒冈州东部，我在约翰迪化石层国家遗址的克拉诺区跳下车，快速拍了一张照片，修了图，然后就把照片上传了。做完这些前，我甚至都没实实在在地看一看这些四千四百万年前火山泥流中的陆地植物和动物化石。
    
    7 ==The **antidote** to the nod-and-go approach（应对（对抗）（点头就走的做法）办法）== is simple: just slow down. This isn't a unique observation, or even a new one. When **photography** was just ==getting off the ground（顺利开始（开启））== in the **Victorian** era, English art **critic** **John Ruskin** criticized how travelers ended up paying less attention when they had a camera in their hand. His advice was to **sketch**, reasoning that ==taking the time to **jot** down（花时间记下来）== even the simplest drawings can help anyone "see" a place better. 
    
    7 要改变这种蜻蜓点水式的游览方式，办法其实很简单：只是放慢速度。这并非独到的观点，也并不新颖。维多利亚时代，当摄影刚刚起步时，英国艺术评论家约翰・罗斯金就批评说，游客手上拿了相机以后对周围的注意力反而降低了。他给出的建议是画素描。他认为花点时间随手画下即便是最简单的几笔也能够帮助人们更好地了解一个地方。
    
    8 That point is certainly **echoed** by many other people. In a newly published book on sketching, the author illustrates how a few **thoughtful** drawings can do a good job of capturing the spirit of an experience. He believes that "sketching uses more of your brain's **capabilities** … creating a more detailed, **layered** map," and I agree with him. 
    
    8 这个观点得到了许多人的响应。在一本新出版的关于素描的书中，作者阐释了具有思想性的图画如何能够很好地表达体验感受的精髓。他认为“素描会调动你大脑的更多功能······创建一幅更为详细、更有层次的图谱”。我赞同他的观点。
    
    9 The key to ==**maximizing** future memories（最大限度地保留记忆）==, then, is just to be present, pay attention to the details that interest you, and ==look at them **closely**（仔细看）== — perhaps even sketch them. Only you know what those details are. 
    
    9 因此，要想最大限度地增强未来记忆，关键就是要亲历体验，关注你感兴趣的细节，仔细观察它们——也许甚至勾勒它们。只有你知道那些细节是什么。
    
    10 Most people take photos when they travel, but not everyone jots down drawings and descriptions in a journal. I've filled 30-some notebooks with a decade's worth of lost travel moments. Lately I've been reading each of them, page by page. It's been amazing. I enjoy the **unfiltered** lines: scribbles about train times, sketches of a bus driver's dramatic **mustache**, ideas for songs I'll never write. These **musings** can ==bring back forgotten memories（唤醒被遗忘的记忆）== and lend color to **cherished** ones. 
    
    10 大多数人在旅行时都会拍照，但并不是每个人都会以图画和文字来记日志。我有大约30个笔记本，里面填满了十年的旅行片段。最近我一直在一页一页地翻看笔记。这真是太有意思了。我喜欢那些未经修饰的内容：字迹潦草的火车时刻，公交司机滑稽小胡子的素描，还有永远不会写的歌曲的灵感。这些思考可以唤醒被遗忘的记忆，并为那些珍贵的记忆增添色彩。
    
    11 I've been telling friends the story about a "**goat** **whisperer**" I encountered on a train in **Bulgaria** for years, but when I sat down to write about it a few months back, I was able to paint the picture more clearly because I had thought to record how the gray-haired man **tapped** his foot as he whispered, that the baby goat was wrapped **snugly** in a blue-and-red **striped** plastic bag, and how it happened en route to **Vidin** on what would have been my dad's 65th birthday. 
    
    11 多年来，我一直给朋友们讲我在保加利亚的列车上遇到的一个“山羊语者”的故事。但当我几个月前坐下来想把它写出来时，我能更加清楚地描绘这幅画面，因为我曾试图记录下这些：那个灰白头发的男人如何一边轻轻踏着脚，一边低声耳语；一只小山羊被温暖舒适地裹在一个蓝红色条纹的塑料袋里；事情如何发生在去维丁的途中，而那一天本该是我父亲65岁的生日。
    
    12 I like to think that each trip has at least one "moment" like this — one that teaches us a lasting lesson or influences how we see the world. Such moments can't be planned, of course, but I try to be present enough to know when one might be happening so I don't just slow down to enjoy it; I stop altogether. 
    
    12 我觉得每次旅行都至少有一个这样的“时刻”——它给予我们深刻的启示或影响我们的世界观。当然，这样的时刻无法提前计划，但我努力去亲历体验，以便在它们可能发生时能够感知，那时我不仅仅是放慢脚步去感受它，我驻足停留。
    
    13 Last October, I traveled to south-central France to ==follow in the footsteps（追随……的脚步）== **Robert Louis Stevenson** took in his book *Travels with a Donkey in the **Cévennes***. When I came to a small lake between the villages of **Le Cheylard** and **Luc**, I knew I was near the spot where Stevenson had offered what would become one of the book's **enduring** **quotations**: "I ==travel for travel's **sake**（为了旅行而旅行）==. The great affair is to move."
    
    13 去年十月，我随着罗伯特・路易・史蒂文森在《塞文山驴伴之旅》中的脚步前往法国中南部。当我来到勒谢拉尔和吕克村庄之间的一个小湖泊时，我知道我走近了史蒂文森到过的地方，在这里他写下了这本书经久不衰的名言之一：“我为旅行而旅行。重要的是步履不停”。 
    
    14 And I **disobeyed** him. I stopped instead — to look and listen. Only then did I hear a few pieces of dry leaves falling through the trees and birds stopping their songs then starting up again. Only then did I notice the **spiky** **chestnut** **shells** below my feet and the **birch** trees **swaying** in the wind — details Stevenson had noted, too. 
    
    14 我没有听从他的话。我停了下来——去细看去倾听。直到那时，我才听到几片干枯的树叶从树上掉下来，鸟儿停止了歌声，然后又开始歌唱。直到那时，我才注意到脚下带刺的栗子壳，以及风中摇曳的桦树——那些史蒂文森书中也提及的细节。
    
    15 I didn't photograph or post any of that, but I sure do remember it. 
    
    15 我没有拍照，也没有发帖，但我确实记住了。

??? info "News report"

    The demand for =="one-size-fits-all" holidays== has fallen as travelers seek trips that are specially designed for their specific interests, says a report launched today. In the last decade, the number of holidays booked through traditional operators has dropped by more than 10 percent, while the number of ==niche holidays== booked online has increased quickly.
    
    Travelers are said to be turning to ==experience-based breaks== that either reflect their hobbies or give them a taste of something completely new, such as ==Salsa dancing== or ==paper-cutting==. The new market is ==being embraced by== wealthy ==baby boomers==, ==empty nesters==, ==adventure-seeking singles==, and =="cash rich, time poor" professionals==.
    
    The report from online travel group Travelzest reveals that bookings of ==standard holiday packages== fell by 8.9 percent during the past four years. They predict further decline, particularly as the Internet drives the niche markets forward.
    
    "We're moving away from a ==mass-market culture== to one of ==unlimited choice==," says Chris Mottershead, manager of Travelzest. "We are seeing much more experienced and confident travelers who care about the world around them and want real travel experiences. Travel companies need to be much more focused on personal interests."
    
    **Questions:**
    
    1. What change has taken place in the travel industry?
    
        A. Holiday trips no longer fit all travelers.
    
        B. More people look for custom-made trips.
    
        C. Travel agencies feel much pressure from travelers.
    
        D. More people book their trips through online travel agents.

            答案：B（不是 D）
    
    2. Which of the following is a characteristic of niche holidays?
    
    3. Which of the following is true about traditional travel markets?
    
        A. They have been replaced by niche markets.
    
        B. They will face further decline.
    
        C. They are of unlimited choice.
    
        D. They cannot offer high-quality holiday packages.

            答案：B（不是 A）
    
    4. What should travel companies do, according to the manager of Travelzest?

??? info "Conversation"

    **M:** When was your first ==solo trip==?
    
    **W:** It was to Philadelphia when I was a 21-year-old student in Michigan.
    
    **M:** How was the trip?
    
    **W:** I was really nervous because I did the trip by bus, and it stopped at a really shady bus station in the middle of the night. It was also my first time taking a ==couch surfing trip（沙发客旅行）==, but I met two of the most wonderful ==local hosts== who showed me ==a side of Philly== I'd have never discovered by myself!
    
    **M:** How did that trip affect you?
    
    **W:** It was an important step in getting me to where I am today. It made me realize I didn't need someone to ==make me feel whole==. When you travel solo, you ==have nobody to rely on== and that pushes you to learn how to function in the world. ==It's the sink-or-swim time!（成败全凭自己）==
    
    **M:** Since that trip, how many times have you traveled alone?
    
    **W:** Already 10 plus. An important reason I like it is that I don't need to arrange my schedule to fit others'. You get to do what you want when you want, or change your plans ==at the drop of a hat（一下子）==.
    
    **M:** Are there any ==negative sides==?
    
    **W:** Loneliness, particularly on ==extended trips==. Yes, in a hostel common room it's easy to ==strike up a conversation==. But it's usually introducing yourself and ==making small talk（闲聊）==. It's nice to have someone you feel comfortable with to share the experience with! For ==budget-minded travelers==, traveling alone is much more expensive than traveling as a couple.
    
    **M:** There's also the issue of safety, isn't there?
    
    **W:** It's definitely less safe than traveling with other people. You're more vulnerable when you're on your own because you have to look after yourself.
    
    **M:** Any advice to our audience?
    
    **W:** Do it! But be smart about it! If you're worried, ==start small（从小处开始）==.
    
    **Questions:**
    
    1. Why did the woman feel nervous on her first solo trip?

        B. She had to stay with two local hosts.

??? info "Passage 1"

    I love holidays! There's nothing better than flying to a foreign destination to visit the attractions. Millions of people are doing the same, and why not? The world has an amazing variety of ==must-see sights==, from natural beauty to old cities. But the problem is that too many of us are visiting them at the same time, ==putting pressure on== these ==delicate and old places==.
    
    That's why a number of ==beauty spots and historic sites== have been ==introducing charges or limits on== the tourists who visit. There are many reasons for this: to ==reduce overcrowding==, to ==manage wear and tear on old buildings==, etc.
    
    The famous Italian city of Venice has, for example, introduced an ==entry fee== of up to €10 for short-stay tourists. Venetians have long complained that ==mass tourism== is ==flooding in== the city. Now, passengers arriving by cruise ship will have to ==pay a "landing tax"==, which is said to ==generate much-needed income== to keep the city clean.
    
    In Italy's capital city, Rome, new laws are being introduced to ==ban bad tourist behavior==, which is ==destroying the look and feel of the city==. Rules include banning eating and drinking by its historic fountains and attaching "love locks" to bridges.
    
    As more of us can now afford to travel, tourist destinations are going to get busier, so maybe new laws and taxes are going to be a necessary part of the travel experience.

    On a gray Saturday morning, I arrived at Manchester Airport, heading on a holiday with no idea where I'd be going. ==At a total loss==, my first surprise journey ==was ahead of== me.
    
    It all started two weeks ago, when I saw that a Dutch company was launching its surprise holiday concept in the UK. The idea is that you choose a type of holiday, for example, ==city break or backpacking trip==, the dates and budget, and then they will ==pick the destination== and ==book flights and hotels==. All you get before you leave is ==a weather forecast== and what time to be at the airport.
    
    I was immediately interested. So two weeks later, I was at the airport, waiting for my flight to Porto, Portugal — a place I knew nothing about. I was a little worried, of course, about ==setting out for the unknown== and, once there, using a card to reveal my destination. But it turned out it was very good indeed. ==Porto has more than its share of must-see attractions==.
    
    And now here I am, coming back from my surprise holiday completely refreshed. I have spoken to a lot of different people, ==visited many out-of-the-way and interesting places==, and tasted ==so many unplanned and unexpected treats==. Most importantly, I didn't ==follow the crowd== and, by ==placing trust in== myself and others, I've come back with more confidence for the next surprise journey.

    I’m calling what I do slow travel. I think it’s worth having a name of its own and distinguishing it from more traditional forms of tourism, or ==backpacking== or other forms of travel. Those methods seem to work really well for a lot of people, which is fantastic. But I personally prefer doing things this way because I find my experiences have a lot more depth. For me, this is about ==cultural immersion== and learning from others how to live life in a different way. As I mentioned before, travel can be very stressful, and living like this is not for everybody. I’ve selected this lifestyle because ==I’m obsessed with== languages and ==immersing myself into foreign cultures==, and I think it just ==brings out the best in me（将……最好的一面展示出来）==.
    
    What is this? I’m defining slow travel as ==traveling at a reduced pace that allows for deeper immersion==. Here are the reasons why I prefer doing things this way.
    
    The first, being (doing) this is much more ==cost-effective（性价比高的）==. When you stay in a place for a longer period of time, you’re getting more value for what you’re paying for. For example, it doesn’t matter if I spend one week in Milan or a whole year. The flight from, let’s say New York City, is going to cost the same amount of money. Here’s another example. Airbnb ==offers discounts== if you stay in a certain place for a week or for a month. Ah … And even better than that is if you ==stay put（停留在原地）== in a certain country, a certain place, for a long enough period of time, you can find an apartment which is gonna cost a lot less than that. And that’s exactly what I did when I was living in Mexico City. When I’m slow traveling, I’m not ==eating out== all the time like you would when you’re doing normal travel.
    
    f you’re staying put somewhere you can buy groceries, cook for yourself, and ==save a ton（省下一大笔钱）==. Finally,when you set up shop somewhere, exploring the region is super easy. You can take really cheap day trips to local cities or nature.
    
    My next point is that it takes a while to ==get integrated in somewhere（融入某处）==. I don’t know when this happens exactly, but I remember ==coming to terms with（与……和解）== the fact that when I visit a certain place, a certain country, for a very short period of time, I always walk away with this feeling of only ==scratching the surface（蜻蜓走水，走马观花）==, of not having actually entered into, you know, that way of life. There’s ==an absolute bombardment on the senses== when you arrive to (in) a foreign place, all the stuff that you ==take for granted==, even the very basic stuff, is suddenly different. In a way, you’re forced to pay attention. I have a funny example. I remember being very confused when I first arrived in Italy on how to, like, ==flush the toilet（冲马桶）==, or ==have the water run（冲马桶）== when you’re ==at the sink==. And I didn’t realize that there’s a ==pedal sort of system==, in a lot of places there. I mean that’s something that I’d never seen before, and I looked like ==a complete idiot== trying to figure out for like a solid four or five minutes.
    
    Anyway, that’s kind of silly example, but you know this idea of adapting and immersing yourself is not something that can happen overnight or even in, you know, a week, right? It takes a lot longer than that. Doing this is, for me, a lot less stressful. Don’t get me wrong. It still is definitely very stressful. But ==the pace of everything is brought down==. And that’s wonderful.
    
    All of this leads me to my last main point, which is that when I go somewhere, I’m trying to ==create a life for myself== there. You know, in a way, I’m kind of able to ==start from zero==, make friends, make a new community, meet people and ==get out there（外出；参加社交活动）==. I wanna learn the language, or wanna learn about the history; I wanna try the food. All the stuff takes a while. And that’s why I’m starting to feel like even three months isn’t enough time because, maybe in three months, you can start to make friends. But then you are leaving. You don’t have the time to actually enjoy them and spend time with them. For the record, three months is still way better than a single week. And it’s gonna depend also on who you are and what works for you. This is kind of what I’m discovering about myself after doing this for several years.

    The creative seat design that creates a coffee shop meeting in the sky just won a Crystal Cabin Award for its clever use of space. It was engineered by students and teachers at the University of Cincinnati together with the Boeing company.
    
    The idea behind the design is for business travelers to increase productivity with a specialized workstation and personal space while flying. The design looks interesting, partly because it suits the style of "coffee shop culture" many people at work are used to.
    
    Designed for twin-aisle planes at a price point around that of premium economy, it changes a section of middle seats into a series of co-working tables, with four passengers seated at each table. For taxiing, takeoff, and landing, the seats would face forward and the wings of the table will pull back. When the plane reaches stable altitude, the seats would turn around, the table wings would lift up and passengers could get to work.
    
    Although it is not expected to be available in any commercial plane any time soon, designs like this give us hope that better airplane cabin designs are not just a daydream.

    **M:** How do you make that possible while you're traveling?
    
    **W:** We live and work in our truck, on eight square meters. We want to travel more, but at the same time have to make a living. I work for a center which helps people who suffer from stress and burnout. When I need to be on site, I simply fly there. Elmer can leave from almost anywhere to the airport where he picks up his shifts as a flight attendant.
    
    **M:** But you left a lot behind. An interesting job at a university, your family, a social life …
    
    **W:** That has been difficult indeed. When I decided to travel with Elmer, I had to give up a lot. Thus, it became a matter of setting priorities and rebuilding my life slowly.
    
    **M:** Living on eight square meters, how do you find enough space?
    
    **W:** We did spend a lot of money on the interior. Almost everything is custom-made and multifunctional.
    
    **M:** Where has your truck already been?
    
    **W:** We've already crossed through Germany, Slovenia, Italy, and Romania, countries where you can park your truck freely in nature. We choose beautiful spots where few tourists come. If we're in a city, we prefer exploring unknown paths and markets. There we can find the best local food.
    
    **M:** This way of living looks like a fantastic and interesting adventure, but it is not meant for everyone.
    
    **W:** Yes, I agree. You need to choose the kind of travel that's right for you.

    Virtual reality technology has taken the world by storm in recent years, with VR headsets becoming a mainstream consumer product. While home adoption has largely been driven by the gaming industry, those within other fields, including the travel industry, are increasingly realizing and exploring the technology's potential.
    
    Businesses operating within the travel industry have been especially quick to adopt virtual reality technology and for good reason. Typically, their customers are looking to purchase experiences, rather than products, and virtual reality offers an effective way to give them a taste of what they can expect.
    
    Travel customers usually require lots of information before they book a hotel room. This may, for instance, require that they read descriptions, view images, look at videos, read customer reviews or seek opinions on social media. Through intelligent use of virtual reality, however, this process can be shortened significantly.
    
    Many hotels and travel companies are now providing virtual reality elements on their websites or apps, allowing users to experience a digital version of a hotel room, or even take a look at one of the nearby attractions. This enables those in the travel industry to provide a kind of "try-before-you-buy" option for the first time. Though the use of virtual reality technology within the travel industry is still at a relatively early stage, it will, in the long run, change the travel industry completely.
    
    **Questions:**
    
    1. What does the speaker mainly talk about?
    
    2. How can VR technology benefit the travel business?
    
        A. It can develop a brand-new business in the travel industry.
    
        B. It can provide travelers with a vivid experience.
    
        C. It enables travelers to visit the attractions for free.
    
        D. It enables the travel business to succeed more quickly.

    It's the adventure of a lifetime: a journey through the cold depths to the wreck of the *Titanic*. The *Titanic* has attracted us since April 14, 1912, when the "unsinkable ship" hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic and was lost beneath the waves.
    
    She wasn't discovered until 1985, and now, three decades later, the *Titanic* Survey Expedition is making it possible for you to see the *Titanic* with your own eyes. Starting in 2021, you can get down to the wreck site in a submersible and explore the remains of the most famous ship in modern history.
    
    If you want to join us, you need to apply to be a Mission Specialist, someone who is part of the submersible team. You'll also have to pay $125,000 for the entire journey. Although the cost is kind of high, what we're offering is an experience that has been impossible until now, and space is likely to be very limited.
    
    You will be trained and coached before and during the entire 10-day journey. As a Mission Specialist, you will have many opportunities to help crew members onboard and support the expedition team.
    
    The expedition promises to be an amazing adventure, a chance to see the *Titanic* before she is destroyed by the severe environment of the ocean floor. If there ever were a bucket list trip, this is it!
    
    **Questions:**
    
    1. What is special about the *Titanic* Survey Expedition?
    
    2. What will you have to do if you want to take the trip?
    
    3. What do you think the passage most probably is?
