    1 In late September 2022, I went to visit a famous **entrepreneur** in Zhongguancun. I entered his office complex from the back door. **Mistakenly**, I took the wrong lift and, as if tripping through a **wormhole**, found myself in the Beijing of the past century. 
    
    1 2022年9月底，我去中关村拜访了一位著名企业家。我从后门走进了他的办公大楼。但我坐错了电梯，仿佛穿越了一条时空隧道，我来到了上个世纪的北京。
    
    2 In the late 1990s, Zhongguancun, now sometimes referred to as China's Silicon Valley, was largely known for its electronics markets **sprawling** along the neighborhood. There were several ==high-rise buildings==, in which you could **wander** around ==vast open floors==   ==packed with **stalls**==   selling   ==a wide **spectrum** of== tech devices from DVD players to phones, cameras to TVs, USB **cords** to printers. Most of them ==were manufactured or **assembled** in China==. 
    
    2 在二十世纪九十年代末，现在有时被称为中国硅谷的中关村以遍布杂乱无章的电子市场而广为人知。那里有几栋高楼，你可以在开阔的开放楼层间闲逛，那里到处是摊位，出售各种科技设备，包括影碟机、手机、相机、电视、USB数据线、打印机等。其中大多数都是在中国制造或组装的。
    
    3 Now, the electronics markets in Zhongguancun are mostly gone. ==Standing **amid** the **glittering** office complex==, which ==is home to some of the most promising high-tech start-ups and R&D companies==, you can hardly imagine what it was like only a few decades ago. 
    
    3 如今，中关村的电子市场大多已经消失了。在闪闪发光的办公大楼中有一些最具前景的高科技初创企业和研发公司。站在那里，你几乎无法想象几十年前那里的样子。
    
    4 There are still some **holdouts** here, so it's easy to ==slip into== an older lift, as I did, and find yourself surrounded by keyboards and printers. But this contrast also ==reminds you of== just how quickly China is changing. "Some people in Silicon Valley still think all China can do is ==**clone** their ideas==, but that's out of date. Now I see China as a major driving force ==for== **innovation** and lots of companies in Western countries are ==copying== China," said an investor working between China and America. 
    
    4 这里依然有一些守旧者，所以你很容易像我一样误入一部旧电梯，发现自己被键盘和打印机包围。然而，这种对比也提醒着你中国的变化有多快。“硅谷的一些人仍然觉得中国只会照搬他们的创意，但这种观念已过时了。现在我认为中国是创新的主要驱动力，许多西方企业正在效仿中国。”一位来往于中美之间的投资者说。
    
    5 For now, these worlds **coexist**: the China of the past and the China of the future. But **increasingly**, the one that ==draws== the world's attention is not ==the factory-and-warehouse aspect of China==, but the new innovation-driven China that is **poised** to reshape the future of global technology, with growing strength in fields ranging from **artificial intelligence** to **drones**. ==The international community== describes China's ==great== development and achievements as "**miracles**." What is the ==**impetus**== behind these miracles? That's why I went to meet with this entrepreneur. 
    
    5 目前，过去的中国与未来的中国共存。但渐渐地，吸引世界关注的不再是 ==中国的工厂和仓库==，而是创新驱动的中国。中国在人工智能和无人机等领域的实力不断增强，势将重塑全球技术的未来。国际社会将中国的巨大发展和成就称为“奇迹”。这些奇迹背后的动力是什么？这就是我要去拜访这位企业家的原因。
    
    6 He told me that ==China's tech landscape== back in the 1990s would ==be **unrecognizable** to（不是 for）== a young person ==of== today. Foreign brands **reigned** **supreme** in the mobile phone **sector**, e-commerce was just a **glimmer** in an entrepreneur's eye, and the ==potential== of the Internet was only vaguely realized. 
    
    6 他告诉我，二十世纪九十年代的中国科技格局是如今的年轻人无法想象的。外国品牌称霸手机领域，电子商务只是创业者的一个模糊想法，互联网的潜力也仅仅得到了初步认识。
    
    7 However, China has ==**accomplished** a remarkable **feat**== in **transforming** itself from ==a low-cost manufacturing economy== to ==a higher-value, innovation-led one==, in only ==a few== decades. According to ==**the Global Innovation Index** 2021 released by **the World Intellectual Property Organization**==, China ranks 12th, moving up two places from 14th in 2020, and ==maintaining **momentum**== for nine **consecutive** years 
    
    7 然而，在短短几十年的时间里，中国就完成了从低成本制造业经济向高价值、创新驱动型经济转型这一令人瞩目的壮举。根据世界知识产权组织发布的“2021年全球创新指数”，中国排名第12位，比2020年的第14位上升了两位，而且连续九年保持上升势头。
    
    8 "==The rise of China as an innovation **hub** has not happened **overnight**==," the entrepreneur said. "This can ==be explained by== China's ==consistent and favorable innovation policies== for more than three decades, as well as by the fact that ==it has **impressively** increased spending on education, science, and technology==." According to official data, Chinese investments in R&D have **burgeoned** since ==the turn of the century==, ==increasing more than ten times since 2000 and reaching a high of 2.4 percent of **GDP** in 2020==. 
    
    8 “中国崛起为创新中心并非一蹴而就。”这位企业家说。“这可以 ==归因于== 中国三十多年来持续有利的创新政策，以及中国大幅增加的教育、科学、技术方面的支出。”根据官方数据，自 ==本世纪初== 以来，中国在研发方面的投入迅速增长。自2000年以来，研发投入增长了十倍以上，而且在国内生产总值中，它的占比在2020年创了新高，达到了2.4%。
    
    9 More importantly, China has the ability to ==translate pro-innovation policy and innovation inputs into sound results==, such as technological **breakthroughs** and high-tech products. After years of hard work, China is now ==leading the world== in the field of **aerospace** technology, high-speed railways, ==5G-enabled technologies==, artificial intelligence, and deep-sea exploration. ==In the long term==, some of these innovations might ==have **profound** effects on the economy and industry==, pretty much like how the invention of electricity and computers changed ==human life==. 
    
    9 更重要的是，中国具备 ==将支持创新的政策和创新投入转化为切实成果== 的能力，如技术突破和高科技产品。经过多年的努力，中国现在在航天技术、高速铁路、5G技术、人工智能和深海探测领域处于世界领先地位。从长远来看，其中一些创新可能对经济和工业产生深远影响，就像电力和计算机的发明改变了人类生活一样。
    
    10 " Innovation is leading China to ride the wave of digitalization and ==**evolve** into== a global tech hub. And the country is **envisioning** ==a shift== from 'made in China' to 'created in China,' from 'Chinese speed' to 'Chinese quality,' and from 'Chinese products' to 'Chinese brands,'" he added. 
    
    10 “创新正在引领中国乘着数字化浪潮 ==发展成为== 全球科技中心。中国正设想从‘中国制造’转向‘中国创造’，从‘中国速度’转向‘中国质量’，从‘中国产品’转向‘中国品牌’。”他补充道。
    
    11 Walking out of the building ==around== 7 p.m. after the interview, ==I found a complex of buildings still brightly lit==, probably with many employees working hard on China's next big innovation. 
    
    11 采访结束后，我大约晚上七点左右走出大楼，发现办公大楼依然灯火通明，可能有许多员工正在努力研发中国的下一个重大创新。
    
    12 ==It is no wonder that== when a few weeks ago I talked to ==a group of Chinese executives== about their recent trip to **Silicon Valley**, ==the **consensus** was confidence==. "What Silicon Valley has done is impressive, but now ==I see the most potential in China==," said one executive. The world ==celebrates== Silicon Valley as a center of innovation, but many Chinese executives, particularly from China's growing technology sector, ==feel increasingly convinced that they can compete **head-to-head**, engineer by engineer, with the best in Silicon Valley or other innovation hubs==. 
    
    12 几周前，我和一群中国高管谈论他们最近的硅谷之行时，他们一致表示对中国充满信心，这也就不足为奇了。“硅谷所取得的成就的确令人赞叹，但现在我认为中国具有最大的潜力。”一位高管说。全世界都在赞扬硅谷是创新中心，但许多中国高管，特别是来自中国不断壮大的科技产业的那些高管，越来越坚信他们可以与硅谷或其他创新中心的精英进行一对一正面交锋。
    
    13 Indeed, the country ==has more than its share of world-class companies that are increasingly rising in **rankings** on size, growth, and, most significantly, innovation==. With ==a huge capital investment, an educated and ambitious **workforce**, a can-do spirit, impressive companies, and a **dogged** spirit== to achieve, China is sure to lead in the era of innovation. 
    
    13 确实，中国拥有很多世界级公司，它们在规模、发展速度和最重要的创新方面的排名不断上升。凭借大量的资本投入、受过良好教育且雄心勃勃的劳动人口、敢作敢为的精神、令人瞩目的企业以及坚忍不拔的进取精神，中国必将引领创新时代。
    
    14 Next time someone tells you China doesn't innovate, suggest that they take a closer look. 
    
    14 下次有人告诉你中国没有创新能力时，建议他们更加仔细地看看。

    1 As the clock ==struck== twelve to welcome the new year, I noticed that Chinese people of all ages were suddenly posting pictures of themselves at 18 on social media. They **reminisced** about their youth, and **regretfully** **remarked** how fast time had flown. 
    
    1 当迎接新年的钟声敲响午夜12点的时候，我注意到各个年龄段的中国人突然都在社交媒体上晒出了他们18岁时的照片。他们追忆似水年华，叹息时光飞逝。
    
    2 Curious, I asked my ==colleagues== about the **phenomenon**. Did something happen that led to this **outpouring**? Or was this an annual *Auld Lang Syne*-type ritual? 
    
    2 出于好奇，我向同事们了解这种现象。是什么导致了这种现象的涌现？这抑或是一年一度的仪式，就像大家都在新年来临之时唱《美好往昔》一样？
    
    3 It turned out to be a **spontaneous** movement to express **amazement** that someone born in 2000 would be an 18-year-old adult this year. This movement eventually evolved into people posting pictures of themselves at that age. 
    
    3 这原来是一次人们自发的活动，他们惊叹那些2000年出生的人今年就年满18岁成年了。这个活动最终演变成了人们分享自己18岁的照片。
    
    4 Other than feeling old, I started to think about how an 18-year-old Chinese has all the advantages of modern China, including the possibility to develop into global citizens, in contrast to their parents and grandparents. They were the first generation to experience the benefits of ==China's reform and opening up==, which began in 1978. Unlike their parents, who lived through **hardship** and poverty, they have never experienced ==an economic **downturn**==. In fact, China's average GDP growth was nearly 10 percent ==**per annum**== from 1979 to 2010. Born and ==raised== as the country's wealth was rapidly growing, they benefited enormously from economic and social reforms. Also, as most of them are the only child in their family, they are ==the **sole** focus of their parents' and grandparents' love and financial support==. Therefore, their ==spending **capacity**== is more ==generous== than past generations. 
    
    4 除了觉得自己老了之外，我开始思考，与他们的父母和祖父母相比，一个18岁的中国人是如何拥有现代中国所赋予他们的所有优势的，包括成长为世界公民的可能性。他们是中国1978年开始的改革开放的第一代受益者。他们的父母经历了苦难和贫穷，但他们却不一样，他们从未经历过经济衰退。事实上，从1979年到2010年，中国国内生产总值的年均增长率接近10%。他们出生和成长于中国财富迅速增长的时期，因此从经济和社会改革中受益匪浅。同时，因为他们大多是家中的独生子女，集父辈与祖父辈的宠爱与经济支持于一身，所以他们的消费能力也比过去几代人都要强。
    
    5 They are also ==more educated and globally aware== than their parents. ==About== a quarter of them are ==college graduates== or above, ==as compared to== only three percent in their parents' generation. ==Born as digital natives with information at their fingertips==, these **youngsters** are more **sophisticated**, ==have exposure to== international cultures and ideas, and enjoy a modern healthy **lifestyle**. They ==tend to be== more **individualistic**, **entrepreneurial**, and **confident**. Young people born after 1990 ==tend to== change jobs frequently. However, there's also **considerable** pressure on them to look after their ==aging== parents and even grandparents. As most of them are the only child in the family, they face ==the **daunting** task of== ensuring the health and ==well-being== of their older generations as they ==**navigate** through their own lives==. However, they are generally very positive about the future, as they are confident about China's growing ==status== in the world. 
    
    5 和父母相比，他们的受教育程度更高，全球意识也更强。他们中大约有四分之一的人是大学毕业或接受过更高的教育，而他们的父辈中仅有3%的人受过同等教育。他们是天生的数字原住民，对信息了如指掌。他们也更加世故老练，有机会接触到国际文化和思想，并享受现代的健康生活方式。他们往往更具有个性、创业精神和自信心。1990后出生的年轻人往往频繁更换工作。然而，他们要照顾日渐衰老的父母甚至祖父母，压力也相当大。由于他们大多数是家中的独生子女，在应对自己生活的同时，他们还面临着一项艰巨任务——确保老一辈人的健康和幸福。不过，总体来说，他们对未来非常乐观积极，因为他们对中国日益提高的世界地位充满信心。
    
    6 In Australia, we would call these young people "millennials" or "Gen Y." ==All sorts of characteristics are **attributed** to millennials such as being tech-**savvy**, **progressive**, environmentally minded, and globally aware==. However, they are also ==**deemed** to be== **self-centered**, **entitled**, ==sheltered==, and even lazy. As the saying goes, ==every generation has its doubts about the one that follows it==. ==Whatever the case may be==, millennials in China are ==a huge phenomenon== that is impacting China and the world in many ways, for example, in its ==consumer behavior==. 
    
    6 在澳大利亚，我们称这些年轻人为“千禧一代”或“Y一代”。人们认为千禧一代具有各种特点，比如精通科技、思想进步、有环保意识和全球意识。然而，他们也被认为是以自我为中心的、享有权利的、受庇护的，甚至懒惰的一代。俗话说，每一代人都觉得一代不如一代。不管情况如何，中国的千禧一代是非凡的一代人，他们在很多方面影响着中国和世界，例如，在消费行为方面的影响。
    
    7 Naturally, Chinese millennials present a vast market. One study shows that **consumption** by young Chinese spenders under the age of 35 ==accounts for== 65 percent of consumption growth. In addition, consumption by these millennials ==is **forecast** to== grow ==at an annual rate of== 11 percent from 2016 to 2021, ==twice that of== consumers older than 35. In three years, ==the share of== total consumption by the young generation ==is projected to== reach 69 percent, as compared to 31 percent by the older generation. 
    
    7 中国的千禧一代自然是一个庞大的市场。一项研究显示，35岁以下的中国年轻人的消费额占消费增长的65%。此外，从2016年到2021年，这些千禧一代的消费额预计将以每年11%的速度增长，这相当于35岁以上消费者的两倍。三年后，年轻一代的消费额有望占到总消费额的69%，而老一代的消费额仅占31%。
    
    8 What kind of products and services do these millennials want? According to another study, Chinese millennials spend most on experiences and products where quality matters. Therefore, what's most important for a product is to have the ability to ==speak to== a millennial's ==**aspirations** and sense of identity==, of which being a global citizen and having pride in China are important factors. **Furthermore**, like most young people, millennials in China are also more likely to spend money on things that make their life more comfortable and convenient. And they want these products and services delivered fast. Hence, millennials ==have driven China's **e-commerce** boom==. They are generally eager to experience ==what's new and **trendy**==. ==See now, buy now, and live for today== may be what some Chinese millennials believe in nowadays. 
    
    8 这些千禧一代想要什么样的产品和服务呢？另一项研究表明，中国的千禧一代在优质体验和产品上消费最多。因此，一个产品最重要的是要能够表达千禧一代的愿望和自我认同感，其中全球公民的身份和民族自豪感是他们身上的重要特征。此外，和大多数年轻人一样，中国的千禧一代也更愿意花钱买一些东西，让生活更加舒适和方便。他们希望这些产品和服务能够快速送达到他们手上，因此，他们促进了中国电子商务的繁荣。他们普遍热衷于体验新潮的东西。“即看即买”、“活在当下”也许就是如今一些中国千禧一代所秉承的信条。
    
    9 After a few days, I managed to find a photograph of myself at 18 as a Grade 12 student in **Melbourne**. However, by that time, the **craze** of posting old pictures of oneself had passed. Chinese millennials have moved on. ==Such is the speed at which these young people move==. To get their attention, we need to move as fast as they do. 
    
    9 几天后，我设法找到了一张我18岁时在墨尔本读12年级时的照片。然而，分享自己老照片的热潮在那时已经过去了。中国的千禧一代在继续前行，这就是这些年轻人的行动速度。要想引起他们的注意，我们也需要像他们一样快速前行。


??? info "U2 Reading 1: Travel in Europe"

    1 I had a strong desire to **roam**. I wanted to ==wander through== Europe. I did make the trip. 
    
    1 我有种强烈的愿望想去四处游荡。我想走遍欧洲。我的确做到了。
    
    2 One of ==the small marvels== of my first trip to Europe was the discovery that the world could be so full of variety, that there were so many different ==ways of doing== essentially the same things, like eating and drinking, and buying cinema tickets. 
    
    2 我的首次欧洲之旅带给我很多小惊奇，其中之一就是我发现世界竟是如此丰富多彩，本质上相同的事处理起来却方式各异，比如吃喝或买电影票。
    
    3 I remember on my first trip to Europe going alone to a movie in **Copenhagen**. In **Denmark** you are given a ticket for ==an assigned seat==. I went into the cinema and discovered that ==my ticket directed me to sit== beside the only other people in the place, ==a young couple locked in the sort of **passionate** embrace associated with **dockside** **reunions** at the end of long wars==. ==I could no more have sat beside them than I could have asked to join in（no more...than...，两者都不。could have done 表 “过去虚拟”）==, so I took a place a few seats away. 
    
    3 记得第一次去欧洲旅行的时候，我在哥本哈根独自一人去看电影。在丹麦，买的电影票上有指定的座位号。我走进电影院，发现在我的票对应的座位旁，只有一对年轻情侣。这对情侣如胶似漆地拥抱在一起，让人联想到旷日持久的战争结束后人们在码头上重聚的情景。我感觉坐在他们边上就如同要求加入他们一样让我尴尬，因此，我选择隔了几个座位坐了下来。
    
    4 People came in, ==consulted== their tickets and ==filled== the seats around us. By the time the film started there were about 30 of us sitting close together in the middle of a ==vast and otherwise empty== cinema. Two minutes ==into== the movie, a woman ==made her way with difficulty down my row==, stopped beside my seat, and told me in a **stern** voice that I was in her place. This caused **fretful** re-examining of tickets by everyone nearby until ==word got around that== I was an American tourist and therefore unable to follow simple ==seating instructions==. Finally, I was directed in some shame back to my assigned place. So 30 of us ==crowded together like **refugees** in an **overloaded** **lifeboat**==. It occurred to me then that there are certain things that some nations do better than everyone else and certain things that they do far worse. 
    
    4 人们陆续地走进影院，对照电影票找到位子，在我们周围坐了下来。电影开场时，在宽敞空旷的观众席的中间，扎堆地坐了约30人。电影开场两分钟后，一位女士艰难地挤到我这排，在我座位旁停下，用严厉的口吻告诉我，我坐了她的位子。这让周围的每一个人都开始不安地重新确认自己票上的座位号，直到人群中纷纷议论说我是一个美国游客，因此没能遵循简单的就座指示。最后，我带着一丝羞愧被指引着回到指定的位子。接着，我们30人如同一艘超载的救生船上的难民一般挤作一团继续观看电影。那时我想，有些国家在某些事情上做得比任何其他国家都好，然而在另外一些事情上，他们却做得糟糕许多。
    
    5 Sometimes a nation's little inventions are so **singular** and clever that we associate them with that country alone — ==**double-decker** buses== in Britain, **windmills** in **the Netherlands**, **sidewalk** cafés in Paris. And yet there are some things that most countries do without difficulty while others cannot ==get a **grasp** of them== at all. 
    
    5 有时候，一个国家的小发明是如此独特、巧妙，以至于我们总是由它而联想到那个国家，比如英国的双层巴士、荷兰的风车，还有巴黎人行道上的咖啡馆。然而，也有一些大部分国家不费吹灰之力就能办到的事情，有些国家却完全无法领会。
    
    6 The French, for instance, cannot ==get the hang of== **queuing**. They try and try, but it is beyond them. **Wherever** you go in Paris, you see **orderly** lines waiting at bus stops, but as soon as the bus pulls up, everyone **scrambles** to be the first **aboard**, quite unaware that this defeats the whole purpose of queuing. 
    
    6 比如，法国人就无法掌握排队的窍门。他们一遍遍地尝试，但这似乎超出了他们的能力范围。无论你去巴黎的什么地方，都会看到整齐的队伍在公交车站排队候车。但公交车一到站，每个人都争先恐后地抢着第一个上车，完全没有意识到，这样一来，他们排队的意义荡然无存。
    
    7 The British, on the other hand, do not understand ==certain of== the fundamentals of eating, as evidenced by their instinct to eat hamburgers with a knife and fork. To my ==continuing== amazement, many of them also turn their fork **upside down** and balance the food on the back of it. I've lived in England for over a decade and I still have to fight an **impulse** to ==go up to== strangers in pubs and restaurants and say, "Excuse me, can I give you a tip that'll help stop those peas **bouncing** all over the table?" 
    
    7 另一方面，英国人无法领略吃的一些基本要领，证据就是他们吃汉堡时本能地会使用刀叉。令我一直感到惊讶的是，很多英国人还把叉子反面朝上放，把食物放在叉子背面保持平衡。我在英国生活了十几年，但在酒吧和餐馆里，我还不得不压制这样的冲动——走上前对那些陌生人说：“打扰了。可以允许我告诉你一个小技巧吗？这样就不会把豆子散落在整张桌子上了。”
    
    8 Germans may be confused by **humour**, the **Swiss** seem to have no concept of fun, and the **Spanish** think there is nothing unusual about eating dinner at midnight. 
    
    8 德国人可能会对幽默感到困扰，瑞士人好像对乐趣毫无概念，西班牙人丝毫不觉得在半夜吃晚饭有什么不同寻常。
    
    9 Yes, there are many differences among Europeans, and language is one of them. 
    
    9 是的，欧洲人是如此不同，语言是差异之一。
    
    10 When I told friends in London that I was going to travel around Europe and write a book about it, they said, "Oh, you must speak a lot of languages." 
    
    10 当我告诉伦敦的朋友，我将周游欧洲各地并要把旅行经历写成书时，他们说∶“哦，你肯定会说很多种语言吧。”
    
    11 "Why, no," I would reply with ==a certain pride==, "only English," and they would look at me ==as if I were crazy==. But that's the great thing of foreign travel, as far as I am concerned. I can't think of anything that ==**excites** a greater sense of **childlike** wonder== than to be in a country where you ==are **ignorant** of== almost everything. Suddenly you are five years old again. You can't read anything; you have only the most fundamental sense of how things work; you can't even **reliably** cross a street without **endangering** your life. Your whole **existence** becomes a series of interesting guesses. 
    
    11 “嗨，我不会！”我会带着一点骄傲回答，“我只会英语。”然后他们就看着我，好像我疯了。但是，就我而言，那正是国外旅游的美妙之处。我想没有什么比置身于一个几乎一无所知的国家更能激发一种孩子般的好奇心。突然之间，你又回到了五岁。你无法读懂任何东西，你对事物的运行方式只有最基本的感知，你甚至无法安全地穿过马路。你的整个存在变成了一系列有趣的猜想。
    
    12 In my hotel in Oslo, the **chambermaid** each morning left me a **packet** of something called *Bio Tex Blå*, a "*minipakke for ferie, hybel og weekend*", according to the instructions. I spent many happy hours **sniffing** it and experimenting with it, uncertain whether it was for washing out clothes, or cleaning the toilet bowl. In the end I decided it was for washing out clothes, but for the rest of the week everywhere I went in **Oslo** I heard people saying to each other, "You know, that man smelled like ==toilet-bowl cleaner（马桶清洁剂）==." 
    
    12 在我所住的奥斯陆的宾馆里，女服务员每天早上都留给我一盒叫作Bio Tex Blå的东西，用法说明上说它是一种minipakke for ferie，hybel og weekend。我乐呵呵地花了好几个小时，闻它的气味，试验各种可能的用法，还是不清楚它到底是用来洗衣服的，还是用来清洗抽水马桶的。最后，我判定它是用来洗衣服的。结果，在奥斯陆余下的几天里，无论我走到哪儿，都听见有人互相议论∶“你知道吗？那个人身上有马桶清洁剂的味道。”
    
    13 However, I wanted to be **puzzled** and **charmed**, to experience the endless variety of a ==continent== where you can board a train and an hour later be somewhere where people speak a different language, eat different foods, work different hours, live lives that are at once so different and yet so ==oddly== similar. I wanted to be a tourist. 
    
    13 然而，无论是困惑不解，还是陶醉着迷，我都想体验一下，我想体验一个大洲的千差万别——你坐上列车，一个小时以后，你所到达的地方，人们语言不同，饮食各异，有不同的工作时间，生活陡然间变得如此不同，但又惊人地相似。我希望做一个旅行者。

??? info "U2 Reading2: The secret to remembering travel"

    1 Whenever I look through all those ==files of things== I've saved over the years, I usually ==stumble upon== some ==long-forgotten== newspaper article I have ==**tucked** away==. I give it a **casual** glance, turn it over, then always find that ==whatever's== on the back is more interesting. **Serendipity** seems to ==win out over== planning every time. Travel is like that. No matter how many journals I fill, photos I take, or posts I send, I find that I often "document" the wrong things. 
    
    1 每当我翻阅这些年来收藏的一叠叠东西时，我常会无意间看到某篇报纸文章，当时随手一塞，早已经遗忘。我漫不经心地看它一眼，又把报纸翻过来，然后发现写在背面的东西总显得更为有趣。机缘巧合似乎总胜过精心计划。旅行也是这样。无论我写了多少旅行日志，拍摄多少照片，发送多少帖子，我发现自己经常记录了错误的事情。
    
    2 While living and teaching English in **Vietnam** in the late 1990s, I filled my journal with reviews of the Western movies I **devoured** ==in between classes==. Unfortunately, not one word described life in the alleys in **Ho Chi Minh City**, a place ==in the **throes** of wild **transition**==. 
    
    2 二十世纪九十年代末我在越南生活和教授英语，我在上课间隙津津有味地观看西方电影，在日记中写满了电影评论。遗憾的是，日记中没有一个词描述胡志明市街头巷尾的生活，而那时，这个城市正处于艰难又激烈的变革中。
    
    3 Similarly, while studying in **Russia** in the early 1990s, I ==snapped roll after roll of onion-domed **cathedrals**== that haven't changed for centuries, ignoring the **babushkas** holding **toothbrushes** for sale outside ==**metro** exits== — ==a **telling** **snapshot** of== the country's first ==baby steps into **capitalism**==, now long gone. 
    
    3 同样，九十年代初在俄罗斯学习时，我对着几个世纪不变的洋葱形圆顶大教堂拍了一卷又一卷的胶片，而对在地铁口外举着牙刷售卖的俄罗斯老奶奶视而不见，这正是这个国家起步迈向资本主义的生动写照，而现在都已经不复存在了。
    
    4 ==Not that== there's anything wrong with ==gold-topped churches==, of course, ==but== I ended up "capturing" the same Russia people can capture today. Now, when I go on trips, I try to listen to what Future Robert is trying to tell Present Robert to notice, to record, to remember. 
    
    4 当然，拍摄金顶教堂并没有什么错，但结果就是我所拍摄的俄罗斯与今天人们看到的俄罗斯并无二致。所以当我现在出去旅行时，我试着听听未来的罗伯特想要告诉现在的罗伯特需要注意什么，记录什么和记住什么。
    
    5 This isn't as easy as it sounds, but it's worth ==bringing up== since most of us tend to over-document when we travel these days. ==Armed with== smartphones and ==**virtually** limitless memory cards==, we take ==hundreds if not thousands== of photos ==without a second thought==. And unlike before, we actually share them — immediately — on social media. 
    
    5 这并不像听起来那么容易，但值得提出，因为当下我们大多数人在旅行时往往会过度记录。配备智能手机和近乎无限容量的存储卡，我们可以毫不犹豫地拍摄数百甚至数千张照片。与以前不同的是，我们还会立即在社交媒体上分享这些照片。
    
    6 That would be fine, but I frequently ==catch myself== rushing like a Black Friday shopper to spread news of my travels ==in real time==. Last week in eastern **Oregon**, I jumped out of the car at the **Clarno Unit** of the **John Day Fossil Beds National Monument**, snapped a photo, ==touched it up==, and ==sent it off==. This is all before I even ==bothered to take a non-virtual look at== the **fossilized** land plants and animals in the 44-million-year-old **volcanic** **mudflow**. 
    
    6 这当然也可以，但我经常发现自己像黑色星期五购物者一样急急忙忙地实时传播我的旅行讯息。上周在俄勒冈州东部，我在约翰迪化石层国家遗址的克拉诺区跳下车，快速拍了一张照片，修了图，然后就把照片上传了。做完这些前，我甚至都没实实在在地看一看这些四千四百万年前火山泥流中的陆地植物和动物化石。
    
    7 ==The **antidote** to the nod-and-go approach== is simple: just slow down. This isn't ==a unique observation==, or even a new one. When **photography** was just ==getting off the ground== in the **Victorian** era, English art **critic** **John Ruskin** criticized how travelers ended up paying less attention when they had a camera in their hand. His advice was to **sketch**, ==reasoning== that taking the time to ==**jot** down== even the simplest drawings can help anyone "see" a place better. 
    
    7 要改变这种蜻蜓点水式的游览方式，办法其实很简单：只是放慢速度。这并非独到的观点，也并不新颖。维多利亚时代，当摄影刚刚起步时，英国艺术评论家约翰・罗斯金就批评说，游客手上拿了相机以后对周围的注意力反而降低了。他给出的建议是画素描。他认为花点时间随手画下即便是最简单的几笔也能够帮助人们更好地了解一个地方。
    
    8 That point is certainly ==**echoed** by== many other people. In a newly published book on sketching, the author illustrates how a few **thoughtful** drawings can ==do a good job of== capturing the spirit of an experience. He believes that "sketching uses more of your brain's **capabilities** … creating ==a more detailed, **layered** map==," and I agree with him. 
    
    8 这个观点得到了许多人的响应。在一本新出版的关于素描的书中，作者阐释了具有思想性的图画如何能够很好地表达体验感受的精髓。他认为“素描会调动你大脑的更多功能······创建一幅更为详细、更有层次的图谱”。我赞同他的观点。
    
    9 The key to **maximizing** future memories, then, is just ==to be present==, pay attention to the details that interest you, and look at them **closely** — perhaps even sketch them. Only you know what those details are. 
    
    9 因此，要想最大限度地增强未来记忆，关键就是要亲历体验，关注你感兴趣的细节，仔细观察它们——也许甚至勾勒它们。只有你知道那些细节是什么。
    
    10 Most people take photos when they travel, but not everyone jots down drawings and descriptions in a journal. I've filled 30-some notebooks with a decade's worth of lost travel moments. Lately I've been reading each of them, page by page. It's been amazing. I enjoy the ==**unfiltered** lines==: ==scribbles about train times, sketches of a bus driver's dramatic **mustache**, ideas for songs I'll never write==. These ==**musings**== can ==bring back== forgotten memories and ==lend color to **cherished** ones==. 
    
    10 大多数人在旅行时都会拍照，但并不是每个人都会以图画和文字来记日志。我有大约30个笔记本，里面填满了十年的旅行片段。最近我一直在一页一页地翻看笔记。这真是太有意思了。我喜欢那些未经修饰的内容：字迹潦草的火车时刻，公交司机滑稽小胡子的素描，还有永远不会写的歌曲的灵感。这些思考可以唤醒被遗忘的记忆，并为那些珍贵的记忆增添色彩。
    
    11 I've been telling friends the story about a "**goat** **whisperer**" I encountered on a train in **Bulgaria** for years, but when I sat down to write about it a few months back, I was able to paint the picture more clearly because I had thought to record how the gray-haired man **tapped** his foot as he whispered, that the baby goat ==was wrapped **snugly** in a blue-and-red **striped** plastic bag==, and how it happened en route to **Vidin** on what would have been my dad's 65th birthday. 
    
    11 多年来，我一直给朋友们讲我在保加利亚的列车上遇到的一个“山羊语者”的故事。但当我几个月前坐下来想把它写出来时，我能更加清楚地描绘这幅画面，因为我曾试图记录下这些：那个灰白头发的男人如何一边轻轻踏着脚，一边低声耳语；一只小山羊被温暖舒适地裹在一个蓝红色条纹的塑料袋里；事情如何发生在去维丁的途中，而那一天本该是我父亲65岁的生日。
    
    12 I like to think that each trip has at least one "moment" like this — one that teaches us a lasting lesson or influences how we see the world. Such moments can't be planned, of course, but I try to be present enough to know when one might be happening so I don't just slow down to enjoy it; I stop altogether. 
    
    12 我觉得每次旅行都至少有一个这样的“时刻”——它给予我们深刻的启示或影响我们的世界观。当然，这样的时刻无法提前计划，但我努力去亲历体验，以便在它们可能发生时能够感知，那时我不仅仅是放慢脚步去感受它，我驻足停留。
    
    13 Last October, I traveled to south-central France to ==follow in the footsteps== **Robert Louis Stevenson** took in his book *Travels with a Donkey in the **Cévennes***. When I came to a small lake between the villages of **Le Cheylard** and **Luc**, I knew I was near the ==spot== where Stevenson had ==offered== what would become one of the book's ==**enduring** **quotations**==: "I ==travel for travel's **sake**==. ==The great affair== is to move."
    
    13 去年十月，我随着罗伯特・路易・史蒂文森在《塞文山驴伴之旅》中的脚步前往法国中南部。当我来到勒谢拉尔和吕克村庄之间的一个小湖泊时，我知道我走近了史蒂文森到过的地方，在这里他写下了这本书经久不衰的名言之一：“我为旅行而旅行。重要的是步履不停”。 
    
    14 And I **disobeyed** him. I stopped instead — to look and listen. Only then did I hear a few pieces of dry leaves falling through the trees and birds stopping their songs then starting up again. Only then did I notice the ==**spiky** **chestnut** **shells**== below my feet and ==the **birch** trees **swaying** in the wind== — details Stevenson had noted, too. 
    
    14 我没有听从他的话。我停了下来——去细看去倾听。直到那时，我才听到几片干枯的树叶从树上掉下来，鸟儿停止了歌声，然后又开始歌唱。直到那时，我才注意到脚下带刺的栗子壳，以及风中摇曳的桦树——那些史蒂文森书中也提及的细节。
    
    15 I didn't photograph or post any of that, but I sure do remember it. 
    
    15 我没有拍照，也没有发帖，但我确实记住了。

??? info "U3 Reading 1: A love letter to long-distance running"

    Dear Running, 
    
    亲爱的跑步：
    
    1 This letter wasn't easy to write. I realize we're ==on a break==, but please know that wasn't ==by choice==. I was told I need some "time to myself." To let myself "recover" — and ==in the process, self-discover==. Still, I can't help but miss you. 
    
    1 写这封信着实不容易。我明白我们现在处在分手阶段，但是请你理解，这不是我情愿的。有人告诉我，我需要一些“自己的时间”，以便让我“恢复”，并在此过程中发现自我。但是，我无时无刻不在想念你。
    
    2 I miss the way you challenge me. Every Day. Pushing me farther and faster, you encourage me to go past the limits and expectations I set for myself — miles and miles past them. And I miss the confidence you give me — you don't just know my body; you understand and appreciate it: ==the sweat-**dripping**, heart-pounding, **breathtaking** times== we share, then the **fulfillment** I get as we finish happily together. 
    
    2 我想念你挑战我的方式。每一天。你鼓励我跑得更远、更快，让我超越自己设定的极限和期望——好几英里好几英里地超越。我想念你给我带来的信心——你不仅了解我的身体，还理解和欣赏它。我们一起度过了挥汗如雨、心跳加速、呼吸急促的时刻，我们一起开心地跑完一段路程，这带给我一种成就感。
    
    3 On those good days, our relationship is **joyful**. But on our bad days, the pain is **unparalleled**. I hate your **brutal** **honesty**, and how you ==hold nothing back from me==. While I try to ==stay tough==, I can't help but wonder how you can hurt every inch of my body so deeply. It's that ==ever-unanswered paradox== — how can something that gives me such pleasure also cause so much pain? ==How is it that== the body you shape is the same one you hurt? 
    
    3 在那些美好的日子里，我们的关系令人愉快。但是，在糟糕的日子里，痛苦也是前所未有的。我讨厌你近乎残酷的诚实，也讨厌你毫无保留地向我坦诚一切。当我努力保持坚强时，我不禁想知道你怎么能把我身体的每一寸都伤得如此之深。这是一个永远无解的悖论∶一件给我带来如此快乐的事情又怎么会引起那么多痛苦？你塑造的身体怎么同时又是你伤害的对象？
    
    4 Yet lately, the mental pain is almost **unbearable**. I try to keep things fresh between us — new routes, and new techniques — so we don't lose interest in each other. Still, I'm being told to ==stay away from you==. "==Take some time off==," they tell me. "Try something else instead." But you **tease** me, **taunt** me, **tempt** me to remain **loyal** to you, even though we both know you're not what I need right now. 
    
    4 但是最近，我承受的精神痛苦几乎到了无法忍受的地步。我通过采用新路线和新技术尽力保持我们之间的新鲜感，这样我们就不会对彼此失去兴趣。但是，我仍然被告知要远离你。他们告诉我：“休息一段时间，试试其他方法。”但是，即使我们俩都知道你现在不是我所需要的，你却依然戏弄我、嘲讽我、诱使我继续对你保持忠诚。
    
    5 Most of my friends hate you — "How can you LOVE running?" they ask. Your name ==doesn't sit well== in our society, either — "running out of money," "running out of time," "running out of reasons / room / patience / options." ==I'm sick of having to explain you（be sick of + 名词 / 代词 /doing sth）==. Others just don't understand. They don't know you ==like I do==. Our ==love-hate, push-pull relationship cannot be put into words==. A lot of times (==namely== 6 a.m. when it's 35 degrees and raining) I don't love you; I hate you. Still, I always find myself running back to you. 
    
    5 我的大多数朋友都讨厌你。“你怎么会爱跑步？”他们问。你的名字在我们的社会中也不受待见——“没有钱了”，“没有时间了”，“没有理由/空间/耐心/选择了”。我厌倦了替你解释，那些人就是不明白，他们不像我那样了解你。我们之间爱恨交加、若即若离的关系无法用言语表达。很多时候（也就是说：早上6点，气温达到35度，天下着雨），我并不爱你，我恨你。不过，我总是发现自己又跑回到你身边。
    
    6 So I guess it's true … I really can't **resist** "the chase." While it hasn't been ==easy==, our relationship is ==deep and dynamic== — you know ==sides of me== I've never shown anyone before. All my weaknesses, **celebrations**, highs and lows, you've experienced them ==right **alongside** me==. My mom's cancer? You were ==my cure==. My dad's ==alcohol **addiction**==? You were ==my **distraction**==. School, jobs, travel, relationships, family — in every stage of my life, you've been ==my escape==, and I've taken comfort ==in== your company. 
    
    6 所以，我想这是真的，我真的无法抗拒”追逐”你。虽然我们之间的关系并非一帆风顺，但是它深厚且充满活力。你知道我以前从未向其他人展示的方面，我所有的弱点、值得庆贺的事情、高潮和低谷，你都陪着我一起经历。我妈妈得了癌症？你帮我疗愈哀伤。我父亲的酒瘾？你帮我排遣烦恼。学校、工作、旅行、人际关系、家庭——在我生活的每个阶段，你都是我的港湾，而我在你的陪伴下感到安慰。
    
    7 But never ==mind== the negatives, we've seen beautiful things together. **Sunrises**, beaches, mountains — ==you name it, we've run it==. You've taken me to places I'd never have the courage to explore alone. You're the one I wake up to every morning, and you help me fall asleep at night. You've so **graciously** let me ==take both pain and pleasure out on you==. 
    
    7 不必纠结那些负面因素，我们一起欣赏了美好的事物。日出、海滩、山脉——只要能想到的地方，我们都跑过了。你带我去了我以前没有勇气独自探索的地方，你每天早晨迎接我醒来，每天晚上助我入眠。你是如此仁慈地让我把痛苦和快乐全都抛给你。
    
    8 Until recently, you were ==my rock==. 
    
    8 直到不久之前，你还是我依靠的磐石。
    
    9 Now, I find myself fighting to forget our past. I'm trying hard not to need you because I know you can't be there for me forever, and I won't always be able to give you what you need. I will age. My body will **weaken**. While ==it scares me to admit==, our time together will, ==for lack of better words== … run out. 
    
    9 现在，我发现自己正在努力忘记我们的过去。我正在努力摆脱对你的需要，因为我知道你不可能永远在我身边，而且你需要的东西，我也无法一直给予你。我会变老，我的身体会衰弱。虽然承认这点有点可怕，但是我们在一起的时间所剩无几（我想不出更好的表达方法）。
    
    10 Although the doctor ==reassures== me this is just "==a **bump** in the road==," it's ==a **foreshadowing**== of the uncertain future ahead of us. Someday I'll find myself back here, ==back on the **sidelines**== **permanently**. But you? You'll be fine. You'll ==move on to== other younger, ==newer models== with miles ahead of them. I'll ==**shrink** back== in envy as you race past me together, and I'll feel even more broken, like ==overused goods==. 
    
    10 尽管医生安慰我说这只是“暂时的问题”，但这预示着我们未来的不确定性。有一天，我会发现自己永远只能站在运动场外。而你？你一如既往。你会去寻找其他更年轻的新人，他们前程无量。当你们一起从我面前跑过时，我会黯然后退，嫉妒不已；我会觉得自己更加残缺，如同一件被消耗过度的商品。
    
    11 Yes, our road ahead is unclear, but we've **tackled** ==tough courses== together before. And I'm excited by ==the **prospect** of== taking each hill, each **curve**, each **hurdle**, ==one step at a time==, ==one foot in front of the other==, just like we've always done. Because I'm not ready for a negative ==**split**==. Not yet. I can't ask you to change — I know you never will — so I'll continue to ==give you my best, all of me==, and ==expect nothing in return== except simply the pleasure of your presence. I'll never forget, ==nor== regret, our times together. I may not always be able to run, but because of you I have strength to at least ==stand on my own two feet==, no matter how ==aged and **cracked**== they may be. 
    
    11 是的，我们前面的道路尚不明确，但我们之前曾共同经历过艰难的路途。我很高兴我还可能像往常一样爬上每座山、跑过每个弯道，跨过每个栏架，一步一个脚印，一步一步向前。我对后段加速还没有作好准备，还没有。我不能要求你作出改变——我知道你永远也不会——因此，我将继续全心付出，全力以赴，除了享受和你在一起的简单快乐之外，别无所求。我永远不会忘记、也不会后悔我们在一起的时光。也许我不能一直跑下去，但是由于你的缘故，我至少有足够的力量可以靠自己的双脚站立，无论它们变得多么衰老、伤痕累累。
    
    12 Gotta run. 
    
    12 我得去跑步了。
    
    Love you always,
    Me 
    
    永远爱你的我

??? info "U3 Reading2: Our parents discovered leisure. We killed it."

    1 My great aunt loved to press flowers. Often she'd **hike** the mountains, searching for new plant life. She'd look up her treasures in **botany** books, then label and press them for **safekeeping**. A few times, she couldn't find ==entries== at all; she'd discovered plant species that no one had named. She was ==a **hobbyist** by nature==. When not caring for family, she would ==dry **pine needles**== and **weave** them into beautiful decorations. But she was also ==a product of her time==. ==In the post-war era==, hobbies were what people did in their spare time, after work: basketball, cooking, writing poems. These were activities ==people didn't feel whole without==. 
    
    1 我的姨奶奶喜欢压花。她经常爬山，在山上寻找新的植物。她会在植物学书籍中查找自己发现的宝物，然后给它们贴上标签，做成压花，以便好好保存。有几次，她在书上根本找不到条目，她发现了尚未命名过的植物种类。她是个天生的植物爱好者。当不需要照顾家庭时，她会晾干松针并将它们编织成漂亮的装饰品。但她也是她那个时代的产物。战后，业余爱好是人们在下班后的业余时间里所做的事：打篮球、烹饪、写诗。没有这些活动，大家会觉得生活不完整。
    
    2 My great aunt died not long ago, but she would have a hard time understanding how my generation uses its spare time. For many of us, the hobby is dead. Our work lives have ==**merged** with== our free time, and hobbies ==are now often**indistinguishable** from== second jobs. ==In a culture obsessed with **productivity**==, the hobby has become the next ==**venture**==. 
    
    2 我的姨奶奶不久前去世了，如果她还活着，她会很难理解我这一代人是如何利用业余时间的。对我们许多人来说，业余爱好已经不存在了。我们的工作已经与我们的业余时间融为一体，如今的业余爱好通常与第二份工作没有区别。在一种执迷于生产率的文化中，业余爱好已成为下一个商业项目。
    
    3 After the US survived two world wars and ==the economic **fragility**== they caused, leisure became more **accessible** for the American ==middle class==. With economic recovery and technological development, **corporations** were able to offer ==structured workweek, job security, higher pay, and paid vacations==, and also let their employees go home at 5 p.m. From ==**disposable** income==    ==a leisure industry== was born — and welcomed by 60 million people. The American road trip, summer camps, and **amusement parks** all competed for spare dollars. People built model planes in their spare time and learned to cook fancy foreign food. Youth culture **emerged** because, for the first time in American history, children were generally not expected to help with work. 
    
    3 美国挺过了两次世界大战及其导致的经济不稳定之后，它的中产阶级比之前更容易获得休闲时间。随着经济的复苏和技术的发展，企业能够提供规律的工作时间、工作保障、更高的薪水、带薪假期，还让员工在下午5点下班回家。由于有了可支配收入，休闲产业应运而生，并受到了六千万人的欢迎。美国的公路旅行、夏令营和游乐园相互争夺这些闲钱。人们在业余时间制作飞机模型，学习烹饪精美的外国食物。青年文化也出现了，因为在美国历史上，人们第一次不指望孩子来帮忙干活。
    
    4 Leisure came to define a person's identity during this time, in many cases replacing ==career identity==. Having a hobby was not only possible; it was ==a status symbol==. ==It meant one had time to relax==, a **privilege** previously enjoyed only by the very **wealthy**. The "**automatic** ==nature==" of many jobs led "an increasing number of workers to ==look not to work but to leisure for satisfaction）==," wrote a US writer in the 1950s. 
    
    4 这期间，休闲开始定义一个人的身份。在许多情况下，它取代了职业身份。拥有业余爱好不仅是可能的，而且还是地位的象征。这意味着人们有时间放松身心，而这种特权以前只有非常富有的人才能享有。一位美国作家在二十世纪五十年代写道，许多工作的“自动化性质”导致“越来越多的工人指望从休闲活动中获得满足感，而不是从工作中获得满足感”。
    
    5 However, post-war **prosperity** gradually disappeared, replaced by ==civil **unrest**, oil **shortages**, and economic uncertainty==. The idea of ==a job for life== and ==a solid pension== disappeared from many professions. By the time of the ==**recession**== starting in 2008, traditional jobs simply weren't available to many young people. And those who did work were **discontented**. 
    
    5 但是，战后的繁荣逐渐消失，取而代之的是内乱、石油短缺和经济的不确定性。终身从事一份工作并拥有稳定的养老金这一概念在许多行业中消失了。始于2008年的经济衰退之后，许多年轻人根本无法获得传统的工作，而那些从事这些工作的人也不甚满意。
    
    6 With fewer reasons to stay in one job, workers began to explore a wider variety of options. For some, these options included turning a hobby into a business. Young people turned to what they loved, what they were good at, ==with an entrepreneurial mindset aimed toward self-employment==. According to a 2015 ==poll==, older Americans' primary concern about their first job was earning money or learning skills. By contrast, 57 percent of millennials prioritized doing something that they found **enjoyable** and that made a difference. Half said they would ==take a pay cut== to find work that ==matched their values==, and would change jobs as their values changed. 
    
    6 由于终身从事一份工作的理由越来越少，人们开始探索更多不同的选择。对于一些人来说，这些选择包括将业余爱好变成一项事业。年轻人带着一种自我创业的企业家心态，转向了自己喜欢和擅长的领域。根据2015年的一项民意调查，老一代美国人做第一份工作时主要关注赚钱或学习技能。相比之下，57%的千禧一代优先考虑做他们认为令人愉快的并且让他们觉得有所作为的事情。一半的千禧一代表示，他们为了找到与其价值观相符的工作宁愿减薪，并会随着自己价值观的改变而更换工作。
    
    7 Instead of viewing work as **inevitable** and hobbies as core to one's identity, as in the post-war era, today's professionals ==strive to **equate**== their career with leisure. An article published this month calls this new phenomenon "the journey of **duality**." 
    
    7 战后，人们把工作视为不得不为之，把业余爱好视作自己个人身份的核心。而如今的职场人士并非这样，他们努力将职业与休闲等同起来。本月发表的一篇文章将这种新现象称为“双重旅程”。
    
    8 Loving what one does is ==a **utopian** ideal==. Few will argue against it. But it's worth remembering a couple of things. Hobbies were something a majority of people could enjoy, while the ==**side hustle**== is more common among the middle class. And even those who enjoy leisure careers might be better off ==taking a break from being productive==. That's tough when we're ==being conditioned to== love our jobs. But perhaps we can copy the post-war ==pattern== **regarding** **boundaries** between leisure and work. We still need to know when to put work down and pick up something else, whether it's family game night, playing basketball, or just being with nature — happiness simply for the sake of it. 
    
    8 热爱自己的工作是一种乌托邦式的理想。很少有人会对此表示反对。但是有几件事值得我们记住。爱好在过去是大多数人都可以享有的东西，但如今副业在中产阶级中更为常见。即使是那些把休闲发展成工作的人，也最好在忙碌之余稍事休息。对我们这些从小被教育要热爱工作的人来说，这很难，但也许我们可以复制战后关于休闲与工作之间划分界限的模式。我们仍然需要知道什么时候放下工作去做一些其他事情，无论是家庭游戏之夜、打篮球，或是与大自然共处——仅仅为了快乐而快乐。
    
    9 For my great aunt, flower collecting was a path to peace outside the home. It was ==a **meditative** return to nature==, something she could ==own== and be alone with. It was not work. Still, I can't help but imagine her today, perhaps ==earning a **paycheck**== as she searches for new plant species, hiking 47 hours per week among the hills. Would it ==**ruin** the **purity** of== her hobby? Or would it **enhance** her life? 
    
    9 对于我姨奶奶来说，搜集花朵是走出家庭获得平静的一种方式，是对自然的沉思式回归，是她可以拥有并独自享受的，这不是工作。而我仍然不禁想象，如果今天她为了一份薪水去寻找新的植物物种，每周在山上徒步47个小时，这会破坏她的爱好的纯粹性吗？还是会改善她的生活？
    
    10 Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing. ==Then again==, I'm a millennial. 
    
    10 也许这也不是最糟糕的事情。话说回来，我是千禧一代。

??? info "U4 Reading1: Why men don't like shopping and most women do"

    1 Do you like shopping? The answer may partly depend on one factor: whether you are male or female. Of course, it's a **generalization** to say, "Women like shopping and men don't" — I'm sure ==we all know people to whom this doesn't apply==. However, there is evidence that this isn't ==a complete **myth**==. A survey of 2,000 British people found that men became bored after only 26 minutes of shopping, while it took women a full two hours. The survey found that 80 percent of men didn't like shopping with their partners, and that 45 percent ==avoided doing so at all costs==. Almost half of all ==**spousal** shopping trips== ended in arguments, with men becoming **frustrated**, because they bought what they needed straight away, while their partners were still looking and taking too long to make decisions. 
    
    1 你喜欢购物吗？你的回答在某种程度上取决于一点，即你是男性还是女性。当然，说“女人喜欢购物而男人不喜欢”，这是泛泛之论——我们认识的人当中肯定都有人不符合这种说法。不过，有证据表明，这一说法也不全然是错误的。一项对2,000名英国人的调查发现，男性逛商店才逛了26分钟就开始觉得无聊，而女性要逛整整两个小时后才会感到厌倦。调查称，八成男性不喜欢陪伴侣购物，45%的男性想方设法避免和伴侣一起购物。夫妻俩一起出门购物，近一半以吵架收场。让丈夫们抓狂的是，他们一下子就买到了需要的东西，而他们的伴侣却还在逛，还要花很长时间才能决定买不买。
    
    2 If ==there is some **validity** to these generalizations== — and if they are more than just the result of social conditioning — where could these different attitudes to shopping **stem** from? 
    
    2 如果这些泛泛之论有些道理的话——而且如果它们不仅仅是社会熏陶的产物——那么这些对于购物的不同态度是由什么造成的呢？
    
    3 For hundreds of thousands of years, until around 8,000 **B.C.E**., all human beings lived as hunter-gatherers — that is, they survived by hunting wild animals (the man's job) and ==**foraging** for== wild plants, nuts, and fruits (the woman's job). 
    
    3 约公元前8,000年之前的几十万年间，人类都是以狩猎和采集为生——也就是说，他们靠捕食野生动物（由男性承担）和寻找野生植物、坚果和果实（由女性承担）生存。
    
    4 Beginning in **the Middle East**, human communities began to ==switch to farming== around 8,000 B.C.E., and slowly, over the following **millennia**, the practice spread widely throughout Asia and Europe. But after so many hundreds of thousands of years of living as hunter-gatherers, it's no surprise that hunting and gathering are still **instinctive** to us. And this brings us back to shopping — because these instincts may show themselves in our shopping habits. When most women shop, they are in more of a "gathering" **mode** — browsing from tree to tree (or shop to shop), looking for ripe and **nutritious** fruits. They spend a lot of time examining the food, checking whether it is fresh and ==**edible**==, and they **discard** quite a lot of it. At the end of the trip, they ==return home **laden** with a wide variety of foodstuffs== (or shopping bags). 
    
    4 公元前8,000年左右，最早在中东地区，人类社会开始向农耕社会转变。在之后的一千年间，农耕方式逐渐广泛传播到整个亚洲和欧洲大陆。不过，人类祖先作为狩猎者和采集者的历史毕竟长达几十万年，也难怪我们现在依旧保留着狩猎和采集的本能。这就把我们带回到购物这件事——因为这些本能会在我们的购物习惯中显露出来。大多数女性购物的时候，她们更多是处于一种“采集”模式——一棵树一棵树地瞧（或者一家店一家店地逛），找寻有营养的成熟果实。她们花很多的时间仔细查看食物，看看是否新鲜，是否可食用，许多食物因此被丢弃。最后，她们带着各种各样的食物（或者购物袋）满载而归。
    
    5 In the same way, men's shopping habits may ==be related to their hunting **heritage**==. This might explain why men appear to be more focused on a single task, rather than looking at different options. In **prehistoric** times, they had one thing in mind: Kill an animal and go home. They didn't want to waste time searching, and it was not so necessary for them to ==examine their food **acquisitions**==. They just looked for animals, killed them, picked them up, and went straight home. Perhaps this rush to get home ==was based on the knowledge that== if a hunter left an animal lying for too long, other animals or insects would start to eat it. Some dead animals would also have been heavy, and so difficult to carry around for long. Also, in hot and **humid** conditions, it wouldn't be long before the meat would start to go bad. 
    
    5 同样，男性的购物习惯也可以和他们的狩猎传统联系起来。这也许可以解释为什么男性似乎更专注于单项任务而不会去考虑其他选择。史前时期的男性目标明确：捕杀一只动物，然后打道回府。他们不愿意浪费时间四处搜寻，也没有必要仔细查看已经捕获的猎物。他们要做的就是：寻找动物、捕杀它们，然后捡起来径直回家。男性这么匆忙回家可能是因为他们知道，如果将猎物长时间留在地上置之不顾，会有其他动物或者昆虫来噬食。有些死去的动物也可能很重，长时间地扛着四处走会比较费劲。况且，在炎热潮湿的环境里，过不了多久，肉就会开始变质。
    
    6 Let me repeat that these are generalizations — there are undoubtedly millions of men and women to whom these characteristics don't apply. And it may seem silly to make these connections between modern shopping habits and hunter-gatherer **traits**. But if there is a **tendency** for men and women to shop in these different ways, then it could be explained in terms of our hunter-gatherer past. 
    
    6 容我再重复一下，以上这些只是泛泛之谈——毫无疑问，有许许多多的男性女性和这些特征不沾边儿。把现代人的购物习惯和狩猎采集的特征这样联系起来似乎有些荒唐。不过，如果说男性和女性倾向于以不同的方式购物，这种倾向或许可以用我们狩猎采集的历史来解释。
    
    7 Of course, I eventually realized that I was not the only person who had thought of it. Several years ago, **anthropologists** **Kruger** and **Byker** found very clear **similarities** between modern men's and women's shopping habits and our hunter-gatherer past. They found that women "scored higher on skills and behaviors associated with gathering … even though the environment and the objects being gathered have changed ==with respect to our **ancestral** environment==. Also as predicted, men scored higher on skills and behaviors associated with hunting." They found that women were more **inclined** to spend **extended** time browsing around shopping malls, while men were more inclined to buy what they needed and then leave straight away. ==Their findings supply **empirical** evidence for== the connections I'm making in this article. 
    
    7 当然，我后来终于意识到，我不是唯一一个这么认为的人。几年前，人类学家克鲁格和拜克发现，现代男女的购物习惯和我们狩猎采集的历史之间存在非常明显的相似之处。他们发现，女性“在和采集相关的技能和行为上得分更高······尽管相较于我们远古的环境，不管是环境还是采集的对象都已经发生了变化。而且，不出所料，男性在和狩猎相关的技能和行为上得分更高”。他们发现，女性更有可能在购物中心逛很长时间，而男性更愿意买到需要的东西后立马离开。他们的研究结果为我在文中所阐述的两者间的联系提供了实证。
    
    8 One good thing about this: It ==provides **justification** for== our shopping habits. You can always use the excuse that you can't help liking (or not liking) shopping, because you ==**inherited** those instincts from our prehistoric past==. More seriously, this might also help us to overcome the impulse to buy unnecessary material goods. 
    
    8 这样建立联系的好处是，它为我们的购物习惯找到了正当理由。你可以总是以此为借口，说你不由自主地喜欢（或者不喜欢）购物，因为你从人类的远古经历中遗传了那些本能。说真的，这还有助于我们克制一时冲动，不去购买不必要的物品。
    
    9 Once you become aware of the reasons for a behavior, it becomes easier to control and overcome it. I'm not saying that we should stop shopping, but perhaps we should shop in a more **sensible** way and bring our buying more in line with our needs than our desires.
    
    9 一旦你弄清楚某种行为的理由，就更容易控制和克服这种行为。我并不是说我们应该停止购物，我的意思是也许我们应该更加理性地购物，应该基于自己的需求而非欲望来进行购物。 
    
    10 But, then again, I am a man, after all. 
    
    10 不过，话说回来，我毕竟是个男的。

    1 **Stereotypes** about women writers are as old as the books written by women. Many female authors — **Jane Austen** and the Brontë sisters among them — ==rose to **prominence**== in the mid-19th century, a period called "the Age of the Female Novelist." But this age also witnessed the development of ==narrow ideas== about women writers and the topics they should write about. **G. H. Lewes** regarded "**sentiment**" as a consistent =="**feminine** **literary** trait;"== **George Eliot**, herself a woman, believed that =="**maternal** affections" distinguished books written by women==. It has been commonly believed since then that women writers are ==**excessively** emotional== and can only write about things like family or feelings. 
    
    1 有关女性作家的刻板印象由来已久，就如同女性作家的作品那么久远。十九世纪中叶被称为“女性小说家时代”，其间许多女性作家纷纷崭露头角，如简・奥斯汀和勃朗特姐妹。但是，这一时代也出现了关于女性作家及其创作题材的狭隘观点。乔治・亨利・刘易斯认为，“情感”向来是“女性文学的特征”。乔治・艾略特，身为女性，也觉得“母爱”是女性作家的创作特色。此后，人们普遍认为，女性作家过于感性，因此，她们的作品仅限于家庭和情感类题材。
    
    2 Since the early 2000s, **gender** **inequality** in the culture industry — literature, music, and film — has gained much attention. In the world of writing, gender **bias** has come to be seen as particularly strong. Studies showed that men appeared over 60 percent more often in some of the most influential book review **periodicals**. This number is valuable because it can track how often **publications** review books by women, but what it can't track is how reviewers then treat women's work: How they write about women and the stereotypes they help to create. 
    
    2 自二十一世纪初以来，文学、音乐和电影文化产业中的性别不平等问题引起众多关注。在文学界，性别偏见显得尤为严重。有研究结果显示，在一些最具影响力的刊物书评中男性的出现频率要比女性高60%以上。这一数据颇为重要，因为它可以用来对出版物中女性作品被评论的频率进行跟踪调查，但是该数据却无法用来跟踪了解书评人如何评论女性创作的作品：他们如何描绘女性，如何共同构建有关性别的刻板印象。
    
    3 This is where our project began. We decided to **analyze** the contents of recent book reviews to see if men and women were written about differently when their books were under review. And we wanted to see if anything had changed over the last 15 years. We examined a collection of 10,287 reviews published since 2000. We labeled the genders of the reviewer and the author under review and then carried out analyses to **identify** language in the reviews that indicated the different genders. 
    
    3 这就是我们项目的出发点。我们决定分析最近的书评内容，看看针对男女作家的作品，评论方式是否有所不同。我们还想了解在过去的15年间评论方式是否有任何变化。我们查看了2000年之后出版的共计10,287篇书评文章，标注了书评人和被评作家的性别，然后进行了分析来识别书评中带有性别指向的语言。
    
    4 The results are shocking. Book reviewers are three or four times more likely to use words like "husband," "marriage," and "mother" to describe books written by women between 2000 and 2009, and nearly twice as likely to use words like "love," "beauty," and "children." However, when describing books written by men, reviewers are twice as likely to use words like "president" and "leader," as well as "argument" and "theory." The results ==are almost too good in their **confirmation**== of gender stereotypes. The book reviews overwhelmingly suggest that women tend to write about ==domestic issues and affairs of the heart==, while men are more likely to write about "serious" issues such as politics. 
    
    4 测试结果令人震惊。测试结果令人震惊。2000到2009年间，在描述女性作家的作品时，书评人用“丈夫”、“婚姻”和“母亲”等词语的可能性要高两三倍，用“爱”、“美丽”和“孩子”等词语的可能性要高近一倍。然而，在描述男性作家的作品时，书评人用“总统”、“领导人”、“争论”以及“理论”等词语的可能性要高一倍。该结果几乎完美印证了有关性别的刻板印象。绝大多数的书评显示，女性作家往往以家庭和情感问题为创作题材，而男性作家的作品涉及政治等“严肃”话题的可能性更大。
    
    5 We might say these results are hardly surprising. Yes, the stereotypes of women writers in book reviews are sad but **predictable**. But what is particularly **startling** about our results is that these stereotypes do not change over time: If you look at the results for the period between 2010 and 2016, the **distinctive** words are nearly **identical**. Men still write about politics and have "ideas." Women still write about "family" and obsess over love or themselves. Many people claim the situation is getting better, but these results clearly show that nothing is changing. In 2010, several periodicals made a **concerted** effort to review more books by women and to employ more women reviewers. In 2014, it was reported that the book reviews in these periodicals were down to a 14 percent bias toward men, and this was regarded as a sign of improvement. 
    
    5 我们或许会说，这些结果并不奇怪。确实，书评中刻板的女性作家形象虽然令人遗憾，却也是可以预料到的。不过，我们的调查结果中让人颇为意外的是，这些刻板印象并没有随着时间而改变：看看2010年到2016年间的数据结果，高频词几乎一模一样。男性作家还是写政治，还是那么富有“想法”。女性作家依然写“家庭”，依然痴迷于情感问题或沉迷于自我。很多人声称情况正在好转，但这些结果明确显示，一切都没有变。2010年，几家刊物共同努力，力图评论更多女性作家的作品，录用更多的女性评论家。2014年，据报道称，这几家刊物书评中男性的出现频率下降，只比女性高14%，而这被视为情况好转的迹象。
    
    6 But things are, in many significant ways, not getting better at all. Although more women writers are now discussed in book reviews, the way they are talked about in the press has not changed. The **discourse** around gender has essentially remained the same since the 19th century: Women writers are still being defined by their "sentimental" traits and a love of writing about "maternal" issues, while men are most often being defined by their attention to matters of science and the state. 
    
    6 但是，在很多重要方面，情况根本没有好转。尽管女性作家的受评率有所增加，但是媒体评论她们的方式并没有变化。十九世纪以来，有关性别的话语基本上没有变过：女性作家的特点依然是她们的“情感”特质，依然是她们对于生儿育女话题的钟爱；而男性作家的特点通常是他们对于科学和国家相关话题的关注。
    
    7 Ultimately, what's at stake in these findings is not simply the question of how to reduce gender inequality in the world of letters, but also how we imagine and recognize such change. **Quantitative** changes in gender **representation** are not **trivial** and they provide a **noticeable** sense of improvement: This year, more books by women were reviewed. Yet, they may also **disguise** the real site of struggle: our **unconscious** attitudes about the idea of women writing books. Many **publishers** have done a great service in **pursuing** better gender representation. But gender representation does not necessarily equal less gender **discrimination**. The pattern is bigger than a head count — it's also about the patterns of ideas and words, which have proven far more enduring and unchanging than we would have thought. 
    
    7 从根本上来讲，这些研究结果不仅关乎如何减少文学界的性别不平等，而且关乎如何想象并认识这种变化。性别比例在数量上的变化并不是微不足道的，它们能够让人清楚地意识到情况已经有所改善：今年，女性作家的作品受到评论的数量有所增加。然而，这些数量上的变化也有可能掩盖了斗争的根本所在：我们潜意识中对于女性从事写作的态度。很多出版物在改善性别比例方面已经作出了很大的贡献。但是，改善性别比例并不一定等同于减少性别歧视。性别不平等的模式不只关乎人数统计——它还关乎思维模式和语言模式，而这些要比我们原以为的更加历久不变。
