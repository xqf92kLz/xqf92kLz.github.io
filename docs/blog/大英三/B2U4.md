??? info "Why men don't like shopping and most women do"

    1 Do you like shopping? The answer may partly depend on one factor: whether you are male or female. Of course, it's a **generalization** to say, "Women like shopping and men don't" — I'm sure we all know people to whom this doesn't apply. However, there is evidence that this isn't a complete **myth**. A survey of 2,000 British people found that men became bored after only 26 minutes of shopping, while it took women a full two hours. The survey found that 80 percent of men didn't like shopping with their partners, and that 45 percent avoided doing so at all costs. Almost half of all **spousal** shopping trips ended in arguments, with men becoming **frustrated**, because they bought what they needed straight away, while their partners were still looking and taking too long to make decisions. 
    
    1 你喜欢购物吗？你的回答在某种程度上取决于一点，即你是男性还是女性。当然，说“女人喜欢购物而男人不喜欢”，这是泛泛之论——我们认识的人当中肯定都有人不符合这种说法。不过，有证据表明，这一说法也不全然是错误的。一项对2,000名英国人的调查发现，男性逛商店才逛了26分钟就开始觉得无聊，而女性要逛整整两个小时后才会感到厌倦。调查称，八成男性不喜欢陪伴侣购物，45%的男性想方设法避免和伴侣一起购物。夫妻俩一起出门购物，近一半以吵架收场。让丈夫们抓狂的是，他们一下子就买到了需要的东西，而他们的伴侣却还在逛，还要花很长时间才能决定买不买。
    
    2 If there is some **validity** to these generalizations — and if they are more than just the result of social conditioning — where could these different attitudes to shopping **stem** from? 
    
    2 如果这些泛泛之论有些道理的话——而且如果它们不仅仅是社会熏陶的产物——那么这些对于购物的不同态度是由什么造成的呢？
    
    3 For hundreds of thousands of years, until around 8,000 **B.C.E**., all human beings lived as hunter-gatherers — that is, they survived by hunting wild animals (the man's job) and **foraging** for wild plants, nuts, and fruits (the woman's job). 
    
    3 约公元前8,000年之前的几十万年间，人类都是以狩猎和采集为生——也就是说，他们靠捕食野生动物（由男性承担）和寻找野生植物、坚果和果实（由女性承担）生存。
    
    4 Beginning in **the Middle East**, human communities began to switch to farming around 8,000 B.C.E., and slowly, over the following **millennia**, the practice spread widely throughout Asia and Europe. But after so many hundreds of thousands of years of living as hunter-gatherers, it's no surprise that hunting and gathering are still **instinctive** to us. And this brings us back to shopping — because these instincts may show themselves in our shopping habits. When most women shop, they are in more of a "gathering" **mode** — browsing from tree to tree (or shop to shop), looking for ripe and **nutritious** fruits. They spend a lot of time examining the food, checking whether it is fresh and **edible**, and they **discard** quite a lot of it. At the end of the trip, they return home **laden** with a wide variety of foodstuffs (or shopping bags). 
    
    4 公元前8,000年左右，最早在中东地区，人类社会开始向农耕社会转变。在之后的一千年间，农耕方式逐渐广泛传播到整个亚洲和欧洲大陆。不过，人类祖先作为狩猎者和采集者的历史毕竟长达几十万年，也难怪我们现在依旧保留着狩猎和采集的本能。这就把我们带回到购物这件事——因为这些本能会在我们的购物习惯中显露出来。大多数女性购物的时候，她们更多是处于一种“采集”模式——一棵树一棵树地瞧（或者一家店一家店地逛），找寻有营养的成熟果实。她们花很多的时间仔细查看食物，看看是否新鲜，是否可食用，许多食物因此被丢弃。最后，她们带着各种各样的食物（或者购物袋）满载而归。
    
    5 In the same way, men's shopping habits may be related to their hunting **heritage**. This might explain why men appear to be more focused on a single task, rather than looking at different options. In **prehistoric** times, they had one thing in mind: Kill an animal and go home. They didn't want to waste time searching, and it was not so necessary for them to examine their food **acquisitions**. They just looked for animals, killed them, picked them up, and went straight home. Perhaps this rush to get home was based on the knowledge that if a hunter left an animal lying for too long, other animals or insects would start to eat it. Some dead animals would also have been heavy, and so difficult to carry around for long. Also, in hot and **humid** conditions, it wouldn't be long before the meat would start to go bad. 
    
    5 同样，男性的购物习惯也可以和他们的狩猎传统联系起来。这也许可以解释为什么男性似乎更专注于单项任务而不会去考虑其他选择。史前时期的男性目标明确：捕杀一只动物，然后打道回府。他们不愿意浪费时间四处搜寻，也没有必要仔细查看已经捕获的猎物。他们要做的就是：寻找动物、捕杀它们，然后捡起来径直回家。男性这么匆忙回家可能是因为他们知道，如果将猎物长时间留在地上置之不顾，会有其他动物或者昆虫来噬食。有些死去的动物也可能很重，长时间地扛着四处走会比较费劲。况且，在炎热潮湿的环境里，过不了多久，肉就会开始变质。
    
    6 Let me repeat that these are generalizations — there are undoubtedly millions of men and women to whom these characteristics don't apply. And it may seem silly to make these connections between modern shopping habits and hunter-gatherer **traits**. But if there is a **tendency** for men and women to shop in these different ways, then it could be explained in terms of our hunter-gatherer past. 
    
    6 容我再重复一下，以上这些只是泛泛之谈——毫无疑问，有许许多多的男性女性和这些特征不沾边儿。把现代人的购物习惯和狩猎采集的特征这样联系起来似乎有些荒唐。不过，如果说男性和女性倾向于以不同的方式购物，这种倾向或许可以用我们狩猎采集的历史来解释。
    
    7 Of course, I eventually realized that I was not the only person who had thought of it. Several years ago, **anthropologists** **Kruger** and **Byker** found very clear **similarities** between modern men's and women's shopping habits and our hunter-gatherer past. They found that women "scored higher on skills and behaviors associated with gathering … even though the environment and the objects being gathered have changed with respect to our **ancestral** environment. Also as predicted, men scored higher on skills and behaviors associated with hunting." They found that women were more **inclined** to spend **extended** time browsing around shopping malls, while men were more inclined to buy what they needed and then leave straight away. Their findings supply **empirical** evidence for the connections I'm making in this article. 
    
    7 当然，我后来终于意识到，我不是唯一一个这么认为的人。几年前，人类学家克鲁格和拜克发现，现代男女的购物习惯和我们狩猎采集的历史之间存在非常明显的相似之处。他们发现，女性“在和采集相关的技能和行为上得分更高······尽管相较于我们远古的环境，不管是环境还是采集的对象都已经发生了变化。而且，不出所料，男性在和狩猎相关的技能和行为上得分更高”。他们发现，女性更有可能在购物中心逛很长时间，而男性更愿意买到需要的东西后立马离开。他们的研究结果为我在文中所阐述的两者间的联系提供了实证。
    
    8 One good thing about this: It provides **justification** for our shopping habits. You can always use the excuse that you can't help liking (or not liking) shopping, because you **inherited** those instincts from our prehistoric past. More seriously, this might also help us to overcome the impulse to buy unnecessary material goods. 
    
    8 这样建立联系的好处是，它为我们的购物习惯找到了正当理由。你可以总是以此为借口，说你不由自主地喜欢（或者不喜欢）购物，因为你从人类的远古经历中遗传了那些本能。说真的，这还有助于我们克制一时冲动，不去购买不必要的物品。
    
    9 Once you become aware of the reasons for a behavior, it becomes easier to control and overcome it. I'm not saying that we should stop shopping, but perhaps we should shop in a more **sensible** way and bring our buying more in line with our needs than our desires.
    
    9 一旦你弄清楚某种行为的理由，就更容易控制和克服这种行为。我并不是说我们应该停止购物，我的意思是也许我们应该更加理性地购物，应该基于自己的需求而非欲望来进行购物。 
    
    10 But, then again, I am a man, after all. 
    
    10 不过，话说回来，我毕竟是个男的。
### Reading 2

??? info "Women write about family; men write about war?"

    1 **Stereotypes** about women writers are as old as the books written by women. Many female authors — **Jane Austen** and the Brontë sisters among them — rose to **prominence** in the mid-19th century, a period called "the Age of the Female Novelist." But this age also witnessed the development of narrow ideas about women writers and the topics they should write about. **G. H. Lewes** regarded "**sentiment**" as a consistent "**feminine** **literary** trait;" **George Eliot**, herself a woman, believed that "**maternal** affections" distinguished books written by women. It has been commonly believed since then that women writers are **excessively** emotional and can only write about things like family or feelings. 
    
    1 有关女性作家的刻板印象由来已久，就如同女性作家的作品那么久远。十九世纪中叶被称为“女性小说家时代”，其间许多女性作家纷纷崭露头角，如简・奥斯汀和勃朗特姐妹。但是，这一时代也出现了关于女性作家及其创作题材的狭隘观点。乔治・亨利・刘易斯认为，“情感”向来是“女性文学的特征”。乔治・艾略特，身为女性，也觉得“母爱”是女性作家的创作特色。此后，人们普遍认为，女性作家过于感性，因此，她们的作品仅限于家庭和情感类题材。
    
    2 Since the early 2000s, **gender** **inequality** in the culture industry — literature, music, and film — has gained much attention. In the world of writing, gender **bias** has come to be seen as particularly strong. Studies showed that men appeared over 60 percent more often in some of the most influential book review **periodicals**. This number is valuable because it can track how often **publications** review books by women, but what it can't track is how reviewers then treat women's work: How they write about women and the stereotypes they help to create. 
    
    2 自二十一世纪初以来，文学、音乐和电影文化产业中的性别不平等问题引起众多关注。在文学界，性别偏见显得尤为严重。有研究结果显示，在一些最具影响力的刊物书评中男性的出现频率要比女性高60%以上。这一数据颇为重要，因为它可以用来对出版物中女性作品被评论的频率进行跟踪调查，但是该数据却无法用来跟踪了解书评人如何评论女性创作的作品：他们如何描绘女性，如何共同构建有关性别的刻板印象。
    
    3 This is where our project began. We decided to **analyze** the contents of recent book reviews to see if men and women were written about differently when their books were under review. And we wanted to see if anything had changed over the last 15 years. We examined a collection of 10,287 reviews published since 2000. We labeled the genders of the reviewer and the author under review and then carried out analyses to **identify** language in the reviews that indicated the different genders. 
    
    3 这就是我们项目的出发点。我们决定分析最近的书评内容，看看针对男女作家的作品，评论方式是否有所不同。我们还想了解在过去的15年间评论方式是否有任何变化。我们查看了2000年之后出版的共计10,287篇书评文章，标注了书评人和被评作家的性别，然后进行了分析来识别书评中带有性别指向的语言。
    
    4 The results are shocking. Book reviewers are three or four times more likely to use words like "husband," "marriage," and "mother" to describe books written by women between 2000 and 2009, and nearly twice as likely to use words like "love," "beauty," and "children." However, when describing books written by men, reviewers are twice as likely to use words like "president" and "leader," as well as "argument" and "theory." The results are almost too good in their **confirmation** of gender stereotypes. The book reviews overwhelmingly suggest that women tend to write about domestic issues and affairs of the heart, while men are more likely to write about "serious" issues such as politics. 
    
    4 测试结果令人震惊。测试结果令人震惊。2000到2009年间，在描述女性作家的作品时，书评人用“丈夫”、“婚姻”和“母亲”等词语的可能性要高两三倍，用“爱”、“美丽”和“孩子”等词语的可能性要高近一倍。然而，在描述男性作家的作品时，书评人用“总统”、“领导人”、“争论”以及“理论”等词语的可能性要高一倍。该结果几乎完美印证了有关性别的刻板印象。绝大多数的书评显示，女性作家往往以家庭和情感问题为创作题材，而男性作家的作品涉及政治等“严肃”话题的可能性更大。
    
    5 We might say these results are hardly surprising. Yes, the stereotypes of women writers in book reviews are sad but **predictable**. But what is particularly **startling** about our results is that these stereotypes do not change over time: If you look at the results for the period between 2010 and 2016, the **distinctive** words are nearly **identical**. Men still write about politics and have "ideas." Women still write about "family" and obsess over love or themselves. Many people claim the situation is getting better, but these results clearly show that nothing is changing. In 2010, several periodicals made a **concerted** effort to review more books by women and to employ more women reviewers. In 2014, it was reported that the book reviews in these periodicals were down to a 14 percent bias toward men, and this was regarded as a sign of improvement. 
    
    5 我们或许会说，这些结果并不奇怪。确实，书评中刻板的女性作家形象虽然令人遗憾，却也是可以预料到的。不过，我们的调查结果中让人颇为意外的是，这些刻板印象并没有随着时间而改变：看看2010年到2016年间的数据结果，高频词几乎一模一样。男性作家还是写政治，还是那么富有“想法”。女性作家依然写“家庭”，依然痴迷于情感问题或沉迷于自我。很多人声称情况正在好转，但这些结果明确显示，一切都没有变。2010年，几家刊物共同努力，力图评论更多女性作家的作品，录用更多的女性评论家。2014年，据报道称，这几家刊物书评中男性的出现频率下降，只比女性高14%，而这被视为情况好转的迹象。
    
    6 But things are, in many significant ways, not getting better at all. Although more women writers are now discussed in book reviews, the way they are talked about in the press has not changed. The **discourse** around gender has essentially remained the same since the 19th century: Women writers are still being defined by their "sentimental" traits and a love of writing about "maternal" issues, while men are most often being defined by their attention to matters of science and the state. 
    
    6 但是，在很多重要方面，情况根本没有好转。尽管女性作家的受评率有所增加，但是媒体评论她们的方式并没有变化。十九世纪以来，有关性别的话语基本上没有变过：女性作家的特点依然是她们的“情感”特质，依然是她们对于生儿育女话题的钟爱；而男性作家的特点通常是他们对于科学和国家相关话题的关注。
    
    7 Ultimately, what's at stake in these findings is not simply the question of how to reduce gender inequality in the world of letters, but also how we imagine and recognize such change. **Quantitative** changes in gender **representation** are not **trivial** and they provide a **noticeable** sense of improvement: This year, more books by women were reviewed. Yet, they may also **disguise** the real site of struggle: our **unconscious** attitudes about the idea of women writing books. Many **publishers** have done a great service in **pursuing** better gender representation. But gender representation does not necessarily equal less gender **discrimination**. The pattern is bigger than a head count — it's also about the patterns of ideas and words, which have proven far more enduring and unchanging than we would have thought. 
    
    7 从根本上来讲，这些研究结果不仅关乎如何减少文学界的性别不平等，而且关乎如何想象并认识这种变化。性别比例在数量上的变化并不是微不足道的，它们能够让人清楚地意识到情况已经有所改善：今年，女性作家的作品受到评论的数量有所增加。然而，这些数量上的变化也有可能掩盖了斗争的根本所在：我们潜意识中对于女性从事写作的态度。很多出版物在改善性别比例方面已经作出了很大的贡献。但是，改善性别比例并不一定等同于减少性别歧视。性别不平等的模式不只关乎人数统计——它还关乎思维模式和语言模式，而这些要比我们原以为的更加历久不变。
