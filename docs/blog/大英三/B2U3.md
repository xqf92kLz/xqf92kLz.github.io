    Having a hobby that you enjoy — whether that's drawing, dancing, or just relaxing on the beach — has all sorts of ==well-documented benefits==, from lower levels of stress to an increased sense of belonging and purpose. But do you know that hobbies can also improve your work performance?
    
    According to professional counselor Rebecca Weiler, when ==you're engaged and fulfilled in== your life outside of work, like when you're pursuing meaningful hobbies, the happiness you get ==spills over==. It can make you more focused and enthusiastic when you're on the job.
    
    Another point is that the skills you gain as a result of your leisurely pursuits can also make you better at your job and make you a more appealing candidate for potential employers. For example, someone who performs in an ==improvisational== group as a hobby could be attractive to an employer because they can ==think on their feet== and may also be more comfortable about presenting themselves in front of a group of people.
    
    So, having a hobby that you love not only has a serious impact on your quality of life, but is also good for your job. But what if you don’t actually have a hobby you enjoy? You're not alone. According to Weiler, trying to find meaningful hobbies is one of the primary reasons that her clients — especially young people — seek counseling.

    ==It has been known that== spending too much time playing video games will ==cause damage to students' health and their academic studies==. ==However, it is less well known that== playing video games for an adequate amount of time may bring young people ==certain benefits like better decision-making skills, improved motor skills, and sometimes even greater vision（更广阔的视野）==. It has also been proved that moderate game playing can help people ==manage stress==.
    
    Many people, especially psychologists and medical researchers, ==believe depression, stress, and other kinds of mental disorders are a result of "patterned" thinking==. They say that every day people wake up feeling like it is just another day and they ==follow the same boring routine==. Slowly, their mind gets used to the pressure and the things that make them stressed every day. So, they live in a state of constant stress. ==Video games break this pattern and provide a mental "breather" to the mind==. It's all about ==re-focusing the brain on something else and getting it to a different zone==.
