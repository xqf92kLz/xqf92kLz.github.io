??? info "A love letter to long-distance running"

    Dear Running, 
    
    亲爱的跑步：
    
    1 This letter wasn't easy to write. I realize we're on a break, but please know that wasn't by choice. I was told I need some "time to myself." To let myself "recover" — and in the process, self-discover. Still, I can't help but miss you. 
    
    1 写这封信着实不容易。我明白我们现在处在分手阶段，但是请你理解，这不是我情愿的。有人告诉我，我需要一些“自己的时间”，以便让我“恢复”，并在此过程中发现自我。但是，我无时无刻不在想念你。
    
    2 I miss the way you challenge me. Every Day. Pushing me farther and faster, you encourage me to go past the limits and expectations I set for myself — miles and miles past them. And I miss the confidence you give me — you don't just know my body; you understand and appreciate it: the sweat-**dripping**, heart-pounding, **breathtaking** times we share, then the **fulfillment** I get as we finish happily together. 
    
    2 我想念你挑战我的方式。每一天。你鼓励我跑得更远、更快，让我超越自己设定的极限和期望——好几英里好几英里地超越。我想念你给我带来的信心——你不仅了解我的身体，还理解和欣赏它。我们一起度过了挥汗如雨、心跳加速、呼吸急促的时刻，我们一起开心地跑完一段路程，这带给我一种成就感。
    
    3 On those good days, our relationship is **joyful**. But on our bad days, the pain is **unparalleled**. I hate your **brutal** **honesty**, and how you hold nothing back from me. While I try to stay tough, I can't help but wonder how you can hurt every inch of my body so deeply. It's that ever-unanswered paradox — how can something that gives me such pleasure also cause so much pain? How is it that the body you shape is the same one you hurt? 
    
    3 在那些美好的日子里，我们的关系令人愉快。但是，在糟糕的日子里，痛苦也是前所未有的。我讨厌你近乎残酷的诚实，也讨厌你毫无保留地向我坦诚一切。当我努力保持坚强时，我不禁想知道你怎么能把我身体的每一寸都伤得如此之深。这是一个永远无解的悖论∶一件给我带来如此快乐的事情又怎么会引起那么多痛苦？你塑造的身体怎么同时又是你伤害的对象？
    
    4 Yet lately, the mental pain is almost **unbearable**. I try to keep things fresh between us — new routes, and new techniques — so we don't lose interest in each other. Still, I'm being told to stay away from you. "Take some time off," they tell me. "Try something else instead." But you **tease** me, **taunt** me, **tempt** me to remain **loyal** to you, even though we both know you're not what I need right now. 
    
    4 但是最近，我承受的精神痛苦几乎到了无法忍受的地步。我通过采用新路线和新技术尽力保持我们之间的新鲜感，这样我们就不会对彼此失去兴趣。但是，我仍然被告知要远离你。他们告诉我：“休息一段时间，试试其他方法。”但是，即使我们俩都知道你现在不是我所需要的，你却依然戏弄我、嘲讽我、诱使我继续对你保持忠诚。
    
    5 Most of my friends hate you — "How can you LOVE running?" they ask. Your name doesn't sit well in our society, either — "running out of money," "running out of time," "running out of reasons / room / patience / options." I'm sick of having to explain you. Others just don't understand. They don't know you like I do. Our love-hate, push-pull relationship cannot be put into words. A lot of times (namely 6 a.m. when it's 35 degrees and raining) I don't love you; I hate you. Still, I always find myself running back to you. 
    
    5 我的大多数朋友都讨厌你。“你怎么会爱跑步？”他们问。你的名字在我们的社会中也不受待见——“没有钱了”，“没有时间了”，“没有理由/空间/耐心/选择了”。我厌倦了替你解释，那些人就是不明白，他们不像我那样了解你。我们之间爱恨交加、若即若离的关系无法用言语表达。很多时候（也就是说：早上6点，气温达到35度，天下着雨），我并不爱你，我恨你。不过，我总是发现自己又跑回到你身边。
    
    6 So I guess it's true … I really can't **resist** "the chase." While it hasn't been easy, our relationship is deep and dynamic — you know sides of me I've never shown anyone before. All my weaknesses, **celebrations**, highs and lows, you've experienced them right **alongside** me. My mom's cancer? You were my cure. My dad's alcohol **addiction**? You were my **distraction**. School, jobs, travel, relationships, family — in every stage of my life, you've been my escape, and I've taken comfort in your company. 
    
    6 所以，我想这是真的，我真的无法抗拒”追逐”你。虽然我们之间的关系并非一帆风顺，但是它深厚且充满活力。你知道我以前从未向其他人展示的方面，我所有的弱点、值得庆贺的事情、高潮和低谷，你都陪着我一起经历。我妈妈得了癌症？你帮我疗愈哀伤。我父亲的酒瘾？你帮我排遣烦恼。学校、工作、旅行、人际关系、家庭——在我生活的每个阶段，你都是我的港湾，而我在你的陪伴下感到安慰。
    
    7 But never mind the negatives, we've seen beautiful things together. **Sunrises**, beaches, mountains — you name it, we've run it. You've taken me to places I'd never have the courage to explore alone. You're the one I wake up to every morning, and you help me fall asleep at night. You've so **graciously** let me take both pain and pleasure out on you. 
    
    7 不必纠结那些负面因素，我们一起欣赏了美好的事物。日出、海滩、山脉——只要能想到的地方，我们都跑过了。你带我去了我以前没有勇气独自探索的地方，你每天早晨迎接我醒来，每天晚上助我入眠。你是如此仁慈地让我把痛苦和快乐全都抛给你。
    
    8 Until recently, you were my rock. 
    
    8 直到不久之前，你还是我依靠的磐石。
    
    9 Now, I find myself fighting to forget our past. I'm trying hard not to need you because I know you can't be there for me forever, and I won't always be able to give you what you need. I will age. My body will **weaken**. While it scares me to admit, our time together will, for lack of better words … run out. 
    
    9 现在，我发现自己正在努力忘记我们的过去。我正在努力摆脱对你的需要，因为我知道你不可能永远在我身边，而且你需要的东西，我也无法一直给予你。我会变老，我的身体会衰弱。虽然承认这点有点可怕，但是我们在一起的时间所剩无几（我想不出更好的表达方法）。
    
    10 Although the doctor reassures me this is just "a **bump** in the road," it's a **foreshadowing** of the uncertain future ahead of us. Someday I'll find myself back here, back on the **sidelines** **permanently**. But you? You'll be fine. You'll move on to other younger, newer models with miles ahead of them. I'll **shrink** back in envy as you race past me together, and I'll feel even more broken, like overused goods. 
    
    10 尽管医生安慰我说这只是“暂时的问题”，但这预示着我们未来的不确定性。有一天，我会发现自己永远只能站在运动场外。而你？你一如既往。你会去寻找其他更年轻的新人，他们前程无量。当你们一起从我面前跑过时，我会黯然后退，嫉妒不已；我会觉得自己更加残缺，如同一件被消耗过度的商品。
    
    11 Yes, our road ahead is unclear, but we've **tackled** tough courses together before. And I'm excited by the **prospect** of taking each hill, each **curve**, each **hurdle**, one step at a time, one foot in front of the other, just like we've always done. Because I'm not ready for a negative **split**. Not yet. I can't ask you to change — I know you never will — so I'll continue to give you my best, all of me, and expect nothing in return except simply the pleasure of your presence. I'll never forget, nor regret, our times together. I may not always be able to run, but because of you I have strength to at least stand on my own two feet, no matter how aged and **cracked** they may be. 
    
    11 是的，我们前面的道路尚不明确，但我们之前曾共同经历过艰难的路途。我很高兴我还可能像往常一样爬上每座山、跑过每个弯道，跨过每个栏架，一步一个脚印，一步一步向前。我对后段加速还没有作好准备，还没有。我不能要求你作出改变——我知道你永远也不会——因此，我将继续全心付出，全力以赴，除了享受和你在一起的简单快乐之外，别无所求。我永远不会忘记、也不会后悔我们在一起的时光。也许我不能一直跑下去，但是由于你的缘故，我至少有足够的力量可以靠自己的双脚站立，无论它们变得多么衰老、伤痕累累。
    
    12 Gotta run. 
    
    12 我得去跑步了。
    
    Love you always,
    Me 
    
    永远爱你的我

### Listening & speaking

??? info "Passage 1"

    Having a hobby that you enjoy — whether that's drawing, dancing, or just relaxing on the beach — has all sorts of ==well-documented benefits==, from lower levels of stress to an increased sense of belonging and purpose. But do you know that hobbies can also improve your work performance?
    
    According to professional counselor Rebecca Weiler, when ==you're engaged and fulfilled in== your life outside of work, like when you're pursuing meaningful hobbies, the happiness you get ==spills over==. It can make you more focused and enthusiastic when you're on the job.
    
    Another point is that the skills you gain as a result of your leisurely pursuits can also make you better at your job and make you a more appealing candidate for potential employers. For example, someone who performs in an ==improvisational== group as a hobby could be attractive to an employer because they can ==think on their feet== and may also be more comfortable about presenting themselves in front of a group of people.
    
    So, having a hobby that you love not only has a serious impact on your quality of life, but is also good for your job. But what if you don’t actually have a hobby you enjoy? You're not alone. According to Weiler, trying to find meaningful hobbies is one of the primary reasons that her clients — especially young people — seek counseling.

??? info "Passage 2"

    ==It has been known that== spending too much time playing video games will ==cause damage to students' health and their academic studies==. ==However, it is less well known that== playing video games for an adequate amount of time may bring young people ==certain benefits like better decision-making skills, improved motor skills, and sometimes even greater vision（更广阔的视野）==. It has also been proved that moderate game playing can help people ==manage stress==.
    
    Many people, especially psychologists and medical researchers, ==believe depression, stress, and other kinds of mental disorders are a result of "patterned" thinking==. They say that every day people wake up feeling like it is just another day and they ==follow the same boring routine==. Slowly, their mind gets used to the pressure and the things that make them stressed every day. So, they live in a state of constant stress. ==Video games break this pattern and provide a mental "breather" to the mind==. It's all about ==re-focusing the brain on something else and getting it to a different zone==.
    
    A study was released by the University of Utah regarding the effects regular gaming has on children who are diagnosed with illnesses like depression. In this experiment, kids who played games, including those specially designed for the study, showed ==great signs of self-empowerment（自强） and improvement in their resilience and fighting spirit==.
    
    **Questions:**
    
    1. Which of the following is not mentioned as a positive impact of video games?
    
    2. Where do scientists find mental disorders come from?
    
        A. The boring nature of everyday life.
    
        B. The "patterned" thinking.
    
        C. The pressure from parents.
    
        D. Irregular sleeping patterns.
    
        ??? note "解答"
            答案：B（不是 A）
    
    3. What can we learn from the study released by the University of Utah?
    
        A. Children who play games regularly have better school performance.
    
        B. Children become more creative by playing more games.
    
        C. Children tend to fight against each other in games.
    
        D. Children with depression become more resilient through gaming.
    
        ??? note "解答"
