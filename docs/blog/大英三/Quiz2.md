        1 The understanding that literature can comfort, **console**, and **heal** ==has been around== since ==ancient Greek and Roman times==. ==It is no **coincidence**== that the ancient Greek god Apollo was the god of medicine as well as poetry. 
    
        1 文学作品的安抚、慰藉和疗愈功效，早在古希腊和古罗马时代就为人所知了。难怪古希腊太阳神阿波罗同时是医药之神和诗歌之神。
    
        2 One of ==the greatest arguments== for using literature as **therapy** ==was **proposed** by== **Michel de Montaigne**, who believed there were three ==possible cures== for loneliness: have a lover, have friends, and read books. But he ==argued== that ==love was too **fleeting** and **betrayal** too common==, and ==while friendship was better it always ended with death==. Therefore, the only therapy that ==could endure through life== was ==the **companionship** of literature==. 
    
        2 米歇尔・德・蒙田曾提出了将文学作品作为疗愈方法的伟大论断。蒙田认为，治愈孤独有三种方法可选：恋爱、交友和读书。但他认为，爱情转瞬即逝，背叛也是司空见惯；相比之下，友情更佳，却会随着其中一方的死亡戛然而止。因此，唯一能伴随终生的疗法就是与文学为伴。
    
        3 Why were the ancient Greeks and Romans ==right to suppose== literature heals the soul? Why did Montaigne trust we could ==endure loneliness through a lifelong relationship with books==? Why, ==despite all the distractions of modern life==, ==do books still get published== and ==writers' festival events get sold out==? The answer lies in the power of stories. 
    
        3 为何古希腊人和古罗马人认为文学能疗愈灵魂的观点是正确的？为何蒙田相信如果我们终身与书为伴，便能忍受孤独？为何在纷纷扰扰的现代生活中，书籍依旧在出版，作家节活动的门票依旧有人买？答案都在于故事的力量。
    
        4 Stories have been around since time began. They tell us ==what it is to be human==, giving us ==a context for the past== and ==an **insight** towards the future==. A **narrator**'s voice ==replaces our stressed, internal **monologue**== and takes us out of our life and into the world of a story. **Paradoxically**, we think ==we are escaping ourselves== but the best stories take us back deeper into our ==**interior** worlds==. It is difficult to ==access emotional language== and this is why we have writers. They ==remind us of the **universality** and **timelessness** of emotions==, helping us better understand our own. 
    
        4 自有时间以来，就有故事。故事告诉我们何为人性，教我们了解过去、洞见未来。叙述者的声音取代了我们焦虑的内心独白，让我们跳出当下的生活，进入故事的世界。矛盾的是，我们以为阅读让我们逃避自我，但最好的故事却让我们更深入自己的内心世界。想要掌握情感语言着实困难，所以才有了作家。他们提醒我们情感的普遍性与不朽性，帮助我们更深刻地了解自己的情感。
    
        5 What stories have shaped you? It's a question ==worth reflecting on==, ==as this shaping is often **subconscious**==. The act of making it conscious will allow your future reading ==to perhaps have a different effect==; you will be "reading" your life from now on, allowing you to ==live it more fully== and understand it better. 
    
        5 哪些故事塑造了你？这一问题值得审慎思考，因为此类塑造通常是在潜意识中进行的。使这种塑造变成有意识的行为，可能会让你未来的阅读产生不同的效果；从今往后，你就是在“阅读”自己的人生，这会让你更充实地度过自己的一生，并且更好地了解自己的人生。
    
        6 Recently, more studies are telling us what the ancient Greeks and Romans already knew: Reading improves our mental health. In 2009, research at the **University of Sussex** found reading could ==reduce stress levels by 68 percent==, ==working better at calming nerves== than listening to music, going for walks, or having a cup of tea. ==Subjects== only had to read silently for six minutes ==to slow down their heart rate== and ==**ease** tension in their muscles==. 
    
        6 近来，越来越多的研究表明，阅读能改善我们的心理健康，对于这一点，古希腊人和古罗马人早已知道。2009年，萨塞克斯大学的一项研究发现，阅读能减少68%的压力，在镇静安神方面比听音乐、散步或喝茶更有效。研究对象只需安静阅读六分钟，就能降低心率、缓解肌肉紧张。
    
        7 A 2013 study found ==reading literary fiction can help us become more **empathetic**==, by giving us the experience of ==being emotionally transported to other places== and ==relating to new characters==. Other studies have shown reading can improve sleep quality and ==ease **mild** **symptoms** of depression and anxiety==. 
    
        7 2013年的一项研究表明，阅读文学作品能提高我们的移情能力，因为在阅读过程中，我们体验到我们的情感转移至别处，并与作品中新的人物产生联系。其他研究则显示，阅读能改善睡眠质量，缓解轻度抑郁和焦虑症状。
    
        8 As a ==**bibliotherapist**==, I ==am **continually** reminded== that ==all forms of literature== can help people ==in all sorts of ways==. A person who ==is **grieving**== may need ==a predictable **plot**== and ==an ordered **fictional** world==; a man searching for direction or ==coming to terms with **retirement**== may need a novel that reflects and explores ==the **transience** of life==; a mother of young children may reach for a novel that ==illustrates the curve of life== and reminds her that although her life is ==**messy** and tiring==, she is ==in just one chapter for now==. 
    
        8 作为一名阅读治疗专家，我时刻被提醒，不同类型的文学作品能以不同的方式给予人们帮助。一个深陷悲痛的人可能需要沉浸在一个情节老套、井然有序的小说世界里；一个正在寻找人生方向或勉强接受退休这一现实的人也许需要读一本展现、探究生命稍纵即逝的小说；一位年幼孩子的妈妈或许需要一本阐明人生轨迹的小说，以此来提醒自己，当前的生活虽是一团乱麻，让人心力交瘁，但她只是处于人生的一个阶段。
    
        9 Sometimes it is not the content of the stories themselves but just ==knowing you have control by choosing to read or listen== that provides the calming effect. All stories offer ==a safe, calm world with a beginning, middle, and end==. We have the power to start or stop and choose ==how long we stay== in the story's world. 
    
        9 有时候，并非是故事的内容，而是你对于阅读或聆听的掌控感，给了你镇静的效果。所有故事都为读者提供了一个安全平静的世界，那里有开篇、主体和结局。我们可以自己决定阅读何时开始，何时结束，以及在故事世界里徜徉多久。
    
        10 ==Time spent listening to authors talk== about their work and their own understanding of the power of literature also allows us, as readers, to reflect on stories that have shaped us. 
    
        10 花时间聆听作家讲述自己的作品以及他们对文学力量的理解，也能让作为读者的我们反观那些影响过自己的故事。
    
        11 "Why do stories ==matter so terribly== to us, that we will ==offer ourselves up to, and later be grateful for==, an experience that ==we know is going to fill us with **grief** and **despair**==?" questions **Helen Garner** in her collection, *Everywhere I Look*. 
    
        11 作家海伦・加纳在她的作品集《我目光所及之处》中问道：“为什么故事对我们如此重要，以至于我们明知它会让我们充满悲伤和绝望，仍要全身心投入其中，并在以后的日子里对此满怀感激呢？”
    
        12 **Robert Dessaix**, in his **memoir** *What Days Are For*, explores ==**narrative** as an "**optimistic** form"==: "Is that why I'm reading a novel ==in the first place==? … It's optimistic ==in the sense that you keep turning the pages, one after the other … in the hope of something transforming happening==. Isn't that it? In the hope of ==a transforming answer to your particular questions==." 
    
        12 罗伯特・德塞在他的回忆录《何为岁月》中探讨了叙事这一“乐观主义形式”：“那不就是我看小说的初衷吗？之所以说它是‘乐观的’，是因为你一页接一页地翻下去，希望转机发生。期待自己的特定问题会有柳暗花明的答案，那不就是乐观主义吗？”
    
        13 Both authors are ==exploring their identity as readers== and the impact reading can have. The writers' festivals ==are more than an event celebrating authors==; they also celebrate the power of literatur and the power of you, the reader. 
    
        13 两位作家都在书中探索自己的读者身份，探索阅读对人的影响。作家节并不只是为作家举办的节日，它同时还是向文学的力量致意，向作为读者的你的力量致敬。
    
    ??? info "Reading2: The evolution of language: How netspeak changes the way we speak"
    
        1 Every year, hundreds of new words and phrases that come from Internet **slang** are added to the dictionary. Some of them are **abbreviations**, like "UR" for "you are" or "your" and "U" for "you." Others are words that have been **stretched** into parts of speech different to those originally intended — for instance, when "trend" became a verb ( "It's trending worldwide" ). Others still have emerged as we adapt our language to new technologies, for example, "**crowdfunding**," "**selfie**," and "**cyberbullying**." 
    
        1 每年都会有数百个来自网络俚语的新词和短语被添加到词典中。其中，有的是缩略词，如“UR”表示“you are（你是）”或者“your（你的）”，“U”表示“you （你）”；有的则是词性被延伸，与原来的不同了，例如，“trend（趋势）”现在可用作动词（“It's trending worldwide”，它正风靡全球）；还有一些词的出现是为了让我们的语言适应新科技，例如“众筹”、“自拍”、“网络霸凌”。
    
        2 You might notice how many of these "new" words are actually just appropriated, meaning they are **pre-existing** words that are combined or given entirely new meanings. For example, "social network" became a word in the *Oxford English Dictionary* back in 1973, referring to the physical activity of networking in a social atmosphere. In the 1990s, people began using the term to refer to virtual **engagement**, and that became an official definition in 1998. 
    
        2 你可能会注意到，实际上很多“新”词只是旧词新用。换言之，它们是早就存在的词，只是被合并或赋予了全新的含义。例如，早在1973年，《牛津英语词典》中就收录了“social network”一词，意思是“在社交氛围中建立关系网的实际活动”。到了二十世纪九十年代，人们开始用这个词来表示“虚拟社交”。在1998年，该意义成了正式定义。
    
        3 Why are so many new words and phrases emerging from the Internet, and why is it happening at such an **accelerated** pace? Actually the Internet isn't the only technological phenomenon that's changed the way we talk. Radio, television, and telephone have contributed their fair share of new words and phrases to our **lexicon** over the last century. 
    
        3 为什么会有这么多的新词和短语在互联网出现，而且速度如此之快？事实上，互联网并不是唯一改变我们说话方式的技术。在过去的一个世纪里，广播、电视和电话也为我们的词库贡献了相当多的新词和短语。
    
        4 For example, the origin of **TTFN** (ta-ta for now) can be **traced** back to a 1940s radio series. Similarly, the word "**doh**" that was made famous by a TV cartoon series became an official word in the *Oxford English Dictionary*, "used to comment on a foolish or stupid action, especially one's own." And don't forget "Give me the 411," the American slang phrase for "Give me all the details," which refers to the telephone number for local **directory** **assistance**. 
    
        4 例如，TTFN（ta-ta for now，回头见）这个表达的起源可以追溯到二十世纪四十年代的一部广播剧。同样，因一部电视动画片而出名的“doh（呀）”一词被《牛津英语词典》收录，“用于感叹愚蠢的行为，尤其是自己的行为”。还有，别忘了“Give me the 411”这个美式俚语，它的意思是“告诉我所有的细节”。“411”是当地的查号服务电话。
    
        5 But the more time we spend online, the less time we spend listening to the radio or watching TV — and smartphones have **blurred** the **distinction** between phones and the Internet. At this point, the Internet could be seen as probably the most **prevalent** influence on our day-to-day dialog. 
    
        5 但是，我们花在互联网上的时间越多，听广播或看电视的时间就会越少——而且智能手机已经模糊了电话和互联网之间的界限。这么看来，互联网对我们日常对话的影响很可能是最主要的。
    
        6 Think about how quickly Internet trends come and go. The fast pace of change on the Internet means we are adopting more words, and doing it faster than ever before. "Language itself changes slowly, but the Internet has sped up the process of those changes so you notice them more quickly," says a professor of **linguistics** at **Bangor University**. You can imagine how much longer it took new words to spread through word of mouth than it does today with the Internet. 
    
        6 想一想互联网上的潮流是如何的来去匆匆。互联网上的快速变化意味着我们正以前所未有的速度接纳更多的新词。班戈大学的一位语言学教授说：“语言本身变化缓慢，但互联网加快了这些变化的过程，所以你更快地注意到了它们。”可以想象，与如今迅速的互联网传播相比，过去的口口相传模式需要多花多少时间。
    
        7 So, how do new words, like the **acronym** "**LOL**," make it all the way to the dictionary? 
    
        7 那么，像首字母缩略语“LOL”这类的新词是如何一路走到词典里的呢？
    
        8 The secret of a new word's success is its **longevity**, says a senior editor in the New Words Group at the *Oxford English Dictionary*. In order for a new word to make it into the dictionary, the general population must use it and keep using it. A word must be in use for at least five years to be considered. So, love it or hate it, when words like "LOL" become common, widespread, well understood, and stick around for more than five years, they're **eligible** for a spot in the big book. 
    
        8 《牛津英语词典》新词团队的一位高级编辑说，一个新词成功的秘诀在于它的经久不衰。要让一个新词进入词典，人们必须使用它，并且一直使用它。一个词至少要被使用五年才可能被考虑纳入词典。因此，不管你喜不喜欢，当像“LOL”这样的词变得常见、应用广泛、易懂，并被持续使用五年以上时，它们就有资格在词典中占有一席之地。
    
        9 There are plenty of Internet slang words that don't make it in, like "wurfing" (the act of surfing the Internet while at work). But to say that word was rejected would be wrong — that word, among many others, will be **revisited** if its **usage** grows. The dictionary is a living, breathing document, and there's always a chance a previously down-voted word will make it into the **mainstream** vocabulary in the future. 
    
        9 也有很多网络俚语没能入选，比如“wurfing”（在工作时上网的行为）。但如果就此说这个词被拒了，那就错了——这个词和其他很多词一样，如果使用量增加，就将会被重新考虑纳入词典。词典是活的、会呼吸的文件。曾被否决的词在未来进入主流词汇的机会始终存在。
    
        10 That's where even the word "slang" gets a little **fuzzy**. Is a word considered "slang" until it graduates into an official word in the dictionary? When exactly does a word become "real"? The fact is, only when a word becomes "real" — that is, widely used and understood — is it considered for a place in the dictionary. "When we see the word in the dictionary, it has already been used for a long time. We see it in the constant **appearance** of slang and **jargon**. Language is not so much a creator and shaper of human nature as a window into human nature." 
    
        10 因此“俚语”的界定也变得有些模糊。一个词在成为词典里的正式词之前是否一直属于“俚语”？一个词到底什么时候才能成为“真正的”词？事实是，只有当一个词成为“真正的”词，即被广泛地使用和理解，才可能被考虑纳入词典。“当我们在词典中看到这个词时，它其实已经被使用了很长时间。我们从词典中不断出现的俚语和行话中能看到这一点。与其说语言是人性的创造者和塑造者，不如说它是了解人性的一个窗口。”
    
        11 As it turns out, dictionary editors look to us when they vote on whether a word should have a place in their dictionary. Dictionaries are fantastic resources, but they are a reflection of humanity and they are not **timeless**. If you ask dictionary editors, what they'll tell you is that they're just trying to keep up with us as we change the language. They're watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what's going to stick and what isn't. 
    
        11 事实证明，词典编辑们在决定一个词是否该在他们的词典中占有一席之地时，依据的是我们的使用情况。词典是极好的资源，但它们只是人性的映射，不是永恒的。如果你问词典编辑，他们会告诉你：他们只是试图在我们改变语言时跟上我们的步伐。他们在观察我们说什么，写什么，并试图弄清楚什么会留存，什么不会。
    
        12 There will certainly be changes in language that we don't like simply because many of us don't like change, but we should be less quick to **impose** our likes and **dislikes** about words on other people. Language change isn't **worrisome**. On the contrary, it's fun and **fascinating**. 
    
        12 当然，这其中肯定会有一些我们不喜欢的语言变化，只因我们中的许多人不喜欢变化。但我们不应该急于把自己对词语的好恶强加给别人。语言演变并不令人担忧；相反，它很有趣、很迷人。
    
        13 So, no matter whether you think netspeak vitalizes or destroys language, there's no denying how revealing it is of the culture that invents and uses it — and the ease with which we adapt our language to new technologies and concepts. Just try to enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually **remaking** our language and keeping it robust. 
    
        13 因此，无论你认为网络语言是赋予语言以活力，还是毁灭了语言，都不能否认它彰显了孕育并使用它的文化，也反映了我们如何轻而易举地改变语言，使之适应新技术和新概念。试着享受参与创造的乐趣吧，这种创造力不断重塑着我们的语言，并使其充满活力。

        3 金枪鱼沙拉三明治最初是出于节俭的一时之举，不料却成了无节制的标志。
    
        4 In the 19th century — before the era of supermarkets and cheap groceries — most Americans avoided wasting food. **Leftovers** of chicken, ham or fish, and some vegetables from supper would be mixed with **mayonnaise** and served on **lettuce** for lunch. 
    
        4 在十九世纪，也就是在超市和廉价食品杂货店的时代来临之前，大多数美国人都会避免食物浪费。晚餐剩下来的鸡肉、火腿、鱼和一些蔬菜会被拌上蛋黄酱，放在生菜叶上充当午餐。
    
        5 Around the end of the 19th century, middle-class women began to spend more time in public, going to department stores, lectures, and museums. Since social **conventions** kept these women out of places where men ate, lunch restaurants opened up to serve these new customers. They offered women exactly the kind of food they had served each other at home: salads. While salads made at home often were made from leftovers, those at lunch restaurants were made from scratch. Fish salads were typical. 
    
        5 十九世纪末，中产阶级女性在公共场所活动的时间更多了：她们去逛百货公司，听讲座，参观博物馆。受社会习俗所限，这些女性不能在男性就餐的场所吃饭，午餐餐厅应运而生，为这些新顾客提供服务。餐厅所提供的食物恰恰就是女性们在家做的沙拉。所不同的是，家里的沙拉通常是用剩菜做的，而午餐餐厅的沙拉则是用新鲜食材制作而成。其中，鱼肉沙拉最具代表性。
    
        6 As further social and economic changes brought more women into public life as office and department store workers, the ladies' lunch became no longer practical, since the office lunchtime was limited. So lunch counters came up with the idea of offering salads between two pieces of bread. This ==sped up table **turnover**（加速了翻桌率）== and ==encouraged customers to get lunch to go（支持外带午餐）==. 
    
        6 随着社会与经济的进一步发展，越来越多的女性进入公共生活，成为办公室和百货公司的员工。由于午餐时间有限，女士们想要优雅从容地享用午餐已不再现实。午餐柜台便想到了用两片面包夹沙拉的主意。这一做法加速了翻桌率，也支持顾客外带午餐。
    
        7 When **canned** tuna was introduced in the early 20th century, lunch counters and home cooks could save the time of cooking a fish and go straight to the salad. But there was a **downside**: The **popularity** of canned tuna led to the growth of a global industry that resulted in the **unintended** killing of millions of dolphins. A clever way to use dinner **scraps** has become a global crisis of **conscience** and **environmentalism**. 
    
        7 二十世纪初，金枪鱼罐头问世，午餐柜台和家庭厨师可以用其直接做沙拉，省去了做鱼的时间。但这也带来了一个问题：金枪鱼罐头的流行促进了一个全球化产业的发展，却无意中导致了数百万海豚被捕杀。一个本是巧用剩饭的举措却引发了全球性的道德危机和生态环境危机。

        11 俱乐部三明治发源于绅士俱乐部，那里直到今天都是以保守主义著称的场所，这种保守包含了对传统菜肴的坚守。有趣的是，直到二十世纪二十年代，三明治才进入为女士提供“精巧”食品的午餐厅。

The **classic** meal includes the sandwich, French fries, and orange juice. 
    
        15 炒面三明治是典型的“东西方融合”的食物，在很大程度上与新英格兰地区的中国餐厅有关——或者更具体地说，与福尔里弗的中国餐厅有关。炒面三明治，顾名思义，就是三明治中夹着炒面。炒面可以放在圆面包里，或是放在切片的白面包中间。它与浇肉汁的热火鸡三明治颇有相似之处。最经典的套餐包括炒面三明治、薯条和橙汁。
    
        16 The sandwich became popular in the 1920s because it was **filling** and cheap. Workers **munched** on chow mein sandwiches in factory **canteens**, while their kids ate them for lunch at schools. They would go on to be available at some "five and **dime**" lunch counters. 
    
        16 这种三明治因为充饥又便宜，在二十世纪二十年代开始流行起来。工人们在工厂餐厅里大口享用炒面三明治，他们的小孩则在学校里以此为午餐。随后，一些廉价品商店的午餐柜台开始售卖它们。
    
        17 For those who grew up in the Fall River area, the chow mein sandwich is ==a reminder of home（一种家的记忆）==. And at one time, Fall River **expats** living in Los Angeles would hold a "Fall River Day." 
    
        17 对于那些在福尔里弗一带长大的人来说，炒面三明治是一种家的记忆。一些居住在洛杉矶的福尔里弗人还一度举办过“福尔里弗日”活动。
    
        18 On the menu? Chow mein sandwiches, of course! 
    
        18 活动菜单上有什么呢？当然有炒面三明治了！

        1 I ==have a **confession** to make==. Five months into my family's year of **devoted** local eating, I moved out. Not because the hours of canning tomatoes in early August ==drove me insane== or because I was overcome by **insatiable** **cravings** for **tropical** fruits, I just went to college. It was a **challenging** life, getting through chemistry and **calculus** while **adjusting** to a whole new place, and the ==limited dining options== I had as a student ==living on campus（live on/off campus 住校/通校）== made it worse. I suppose I could have tried to grow some vegetables in the college yards or filled my **dorm** room with potted tomato and **zucchini** plants, but then people would really have made fun of me for being from **Appalachia**. Instead, I ate lettuce and **cucumbers** in January just like all the other kids. 
    
        1 我要坦白一件事，有一年，我的家人们热衷于食用本地食物，但我只吃了五个月就搬出了家。我搬出去并不是因为八月初花数小时制作西红柿罐头这件事让我崩溃，也不是因为我抵挡不了对热带水果永无止境的渴望，我的离开是因为求学。大学生活充满了挑战，我一边要适应全新的环境，一边要应付化学和微积分课程，加之我住在学校里，食堂有限的菜品让我的住校生活变得更加糟糕。我想我本可以试着在学校的院子里种些蔬菜或是在我的宿舍里种一些盆栽的西红柿和西葫芦，但如果我这么做的话，别人肯定会嘲笑我是个从阿巴拉契亚地区出来的土包子。最终，我跟其他孩子一样，在一月份吃着生菜和黄瓜。
    
        2 Not ==having fresh produce at my **disposal**== made me realize how good it is. I also noticed that how I think about food is pretty unusual among my peers. When I **perused** the salad bar at my dining hall most evenings, **grimly** surveying the **mealy**, **pinkish** tomatoes and paper-like **iceberg lettuce**, I could pick out what probably came from South America or New Zealand. I always kept this information to myself (because who really cares when there are basketball games and parties to talk about?) but I couldn't help noticing it. 
    
        2 没有新鲜的农产品可吃，让我意识到了它们的珍贵。我也察觉到我对食物的理解和同龄人很不相同。大多数的晚上，当我审视着餐厅里的沙拉吧，沮丧地打量着那些干巴难吃的浅红色的西红柿和像纸一样的卷心莴苣时，我都能大致分辨出哪些来自南美，哪些来自新西兰。对于这一切，我从来都秘而不宣（因为人们在忙着讨论篮球比赛和派对，谁会真正在乎这些呢？），但我还是忍不住留心这件事。
    
        3 I suppose my generation is farther removed from food production than any other. More than our parents, we rely on foods that come out of shiny **wrappers** instead of **peels** or skins. It still surprises a girl like me, who actually lives on a real farm with real animals and stuff growing out of the ground, that so many young adults couldn't guess where their food comes from, or when it's ==in season== where they live. It's not that my rising generation is unintelligent or **unworldly** — my classmates are some of the smartest, most **cultured** people I know. But information about food and farming is not readily available. Most of the people I know have never seen a working farm or had any reason to do so. Living among people my age from various cities across the United States made me realize that I actually know a lot about food production, and I don't take this **realization** for **granted**. 
    
        3 我想我这一代人与食品生产的距离比之前任何一代人都要远。比起我们的父母，我们更依赖闪亮的包装纸里包着的食物，而不是那些需要用手剥壳去皮的食物。但让一个像我这样生活在农场里、见过活的动物和长在地里的庄稼的女孩仍然感到惊讶的是，那么多年轻人不知道他们的食物从何而来，也不知道在他们生活的那个地方每个季节有什么时令果蔬。这当然不是因为我们年轻的这一代不聪明或是不谙世事——我的同学是我认识的最聪明、最有素养的一些人，而是因为与食物和耕作相关的信息不易获取。我认识的大多数人从来没见过也没想过要去了解真正的农场。置身于来自美国五湖四海的同龄人中间，我意识到我其实拥有大量食品生产的知识，而意识到这一点并非偶然。
    
        4 I also won't forget to appreciate how much better local food tastes. Next to getting a good night's sleep on a comfortable bed, cooking good food became my main **motivation** for coming home from school to visit. Of course seeing my family was nice, but **priorities** are priorities, right? It was great after weeks of dorm life to eat eggs with deep **golden** **yolks**, and greens that still had their flavor and **crunch**. I loved being able to look at a table full of food and know where every vegetable was grown. 
    
        4 我同样不会忘记赞美一下本地食物，它们美味得多了。除了能在舒适的床上睡个好觉外，烹饪美食也是我回家的主要动力。当然，见到家人是美好的，但首要任务始终是首要任务，对吧？在数周的宿舍生活后吃到有金色蛋黄的鸡蛋以及原汁原味、脆爽劲十足的绿色蔬菜真是太棒了。看着一大桌子食物，知道每种蔬菜从何而来，这种感觉我实在是太喜欢了。
    
        5 During my first year of college I found two campus canteens that use ==**organic**, locally grown produce（本地种植的有机农产品）== in their meals, and one that consistently uses ==**free-range** meat（放养猪的猪肉）==. For the most part, these vendors did not widely advertise the fact that they were **participating** in the ==local food economy==. I only found out because I cared, and then tried to buy most of my food from those places. 
    
        5 在我上大学的头一年，我在学校里发现了两家使用本地种植的有机农产品来制作食物的餐厅，还有一家餐厅使用的一直是放养动物的肉。通常，这些店家并不四处宣传他们参与促进本地食品经济这一事实。我之所以能发现，是因为我关心食品生产。在那之后，大多数食物我都会在这些地方购买。
    
        6 My generation, I know, has the reputation of sticking **earbuds** in our ears and not caring about what might happen in 10 years, or even next week. But we do care about a lot of things, including what we eat. Food is something real. Living on the land that has grown my food gives me a sense of security which I feel lucky to have. Feeling safe isn't so easy for people my age, who face horrible threats like global warming, overpopulation, and chemical abuse. But even as the world runs out of fuel and the ice caps **melt**, I will know the real sources of my **sustenance**. My college education may or may not ==land me a good job== down the road, but my farm education will definitely ==have a **profound** and **far-reaching** influence on== me. The choices I make now about my food will influence the rest of my life. If a lot of us felt this way and started thinking carefully about our consumption habits just one meal at a time, we could affect the future of our planet. No matter how **grave** the **predictions** I hear about the future, for my peers and me, that's a fact that gives me hope. 
    
        6 我知道，我们一直被认为是耳朵里塞着耳机、对十年甚至未来一周之后可能会发生的事不闻不问的一代人。但事实上，我们对很多事都很关心，包括我们吃的食物。食物是真实的存在。生活在种植了我的食物的土地上给我一种安全感，我很幸运能拥有这种安全感。面临着诸如全球变暖、人口过剩和滥用化学物品这样的可怕威胁，能拥有安全感对我这个年纪的人来说并不容易。但是，即使世界燃料耗尽，冰盖融化，我依然知道我赖以生存的食物从何而来。我所接受的高等教育也许能带给我一份好工作，也许不能，但我在农场受到的熏陶一定会对我产生深远的影响。我现在作出的食物选择将影响我的余生。如果我们很多人都能意识到这一点，并开始认真思考我们的消费习惯，哪怕只是某次吃饭时想一想，都可能改变我们整个星球的未来。无论我听到的对未来的预测有多么严峻，对我和我的同龄人来说，那是一个能给我带来希望的事实。

    ??? info "Reading 1: Let there be dark"
    
        1 When I was a child, I knew real darkness. 
    
        1 当我还是个孩子的时候，我见过真正的一片漆黑。
    
        2 At my family's **cabin** on a **Minnesota** lake, I knew woods so dark that my hands disappeared before my eyes. I knew night skies in which **meteors** left **smoky** **trails** across **sugary** spreads of stars. But now, when eight of ten children born in the United States will never know a sky dark enough for **the Milky Way**, I worry we are rapidly losing night's natural darkness before realizing its worth. This **winter solstice**, as we cheer the days' gradual movement back toward light, let us also remember the **irreplaceable** value of darkness. 
    
        2 我家的小屋坐落在明尼苏达州的一个湖畔，在那儿，我见过漆黑一片、伸手不见五指的树林；也见过被细砂糖般的繁星点缀的夜空。彗星扫过，在那里留下烟雾般的痕迹。可如今，在美国，每十个孩子中就有八个将永远也不会知道那种黑到足以看到银河的夜空是什么样子的，因此，我担心，在我们还未意识到夜晚的自然黑暗的价值之前，就已经在快速地失去它了。今年冬至，当我们为黑夜逐渐缩短、白天逐渐变长而欢呼时，让我们也记住黑夜不可替代的价值。
    
        3 All life evolved to the steady **rhythm** of bright days and dark nights. Today, though, when we feel the closeness of **nightfall**, we reach quickly for a light switch. And too little darkness, meaning too much artificial light at night, spells trouble for all. 
    
        3 所有生物进化以适应昼夜节律。而今，当我们感觉到夜幕降临时，便急忙去打开灯。夜晚的黑暗过少意味着人工光亮过多，这会对所有生物产生不利影响。
    
        4 Already **the World Health Organization** identified working the **night shift** as a **probable** cause of cancer and **the American Medical Association** has voiced its support for "light pollution **reduction** efforts at both the national and state levels." Our bodies need darkness to produce the **hormone** **melatonin**, which keeps certain cancers from developing, and our bodies need darkness for sleep. Sleep **disorders** have been linked to **diabetes**, **obesity**, heart disease and depression, and recent research suggests one main cause of "short sleep" is "long light." Whether we work at night or simply take our smartphones to bed, there isn't a place for this much artificial light in our lives. 
    
        4 世界卫生组织已将上夜班认定为可能导致癌症的一个因素，美国医学会发声支持“在国家和州范围内努力减少光污染”。我们的身体需要黑暗来制造遏制某些癌症发展的褪黑素这种激素，我们的身体也需要黑暗来保证睡眠。睡眠紊乱会导致糖尿病、肥胖、心脏病和抑郁症。最近的研究也显示，引起“短睡眠”的主要原因之一是“长照明”。无论我们在夜晚工作，抑或只是在床上看智能手机，我们的生活中不应该有如此多的人工光亮。
    
        5 The rest of the world ==depends on darkness as well==, including ==certain species== of birds, insects, and fish. Some examples ==are well known== — the 400 species of birds that **migrate** at night in North America, the **sea turtles** that ==come on shore to lay their eggs== — and ==some are not==, such as the bats that save American farmers billions ==in **pest** control==. ==Light pollution== is like the ==**bulldozer** of the night==, ==**wrecking** **habitat**== and ==**disrupting** **ecosystems** which are several billion years in the making==. Simply put, without darkness, Earth's ecosystems would **collapse**. 
    
        5 地球上的其他生物物种也离不开黑夜，如一些鸟类、昆虫和鱼类。有些例子我们耳熟能详：在北美，有400种鸟类在夜晚迁徙，海龟在夜晚游到岸上产卵；有些例子不太为人所知：美国农民利用蝙蝠控制害虫，节约了数十亿美元。光污染就像推土机，它打破了黑夜，捣毁了栖息地，扰乱了几十亿年造就的生态系统。简言之，假如黑夜消失，地球的生态系统就会崩塌。
    
        6 Darkness shapes our lives in ==less dramatic ways== as well. Consider how it brings us together with those we love, how we **illuminate** our most ==**intimate** experiences== with **flame** or moonlight. What would a winter evening's ==stroll== through the park be without it? Or a ==candlelight dinner==? It's only with night's natural darkness that we appreciate the lights of the city and of the season. No one thinks much of these lights at noon. 
    
        6 黑暗也以它温和的方式改变着我们的生活。想一想黑暗如何让我们与我们爱的人团聚，火光或月光如何照亮了我们最温馨的体验。如果没有黑暗，在冬夜的公园漫步，享用烛光晚餐，那还会是同样的体验吗？唯有夜的自然黑暗才让我们珍惜城市的灯光和季节的明媚。在正午，没有人会对这些光亮有深刻体会。
    
        7 In today's crowded, louder, more ==fast-paced== world, night's darkness can provide ==**solitude** and quietness, qualities increasingly in short supply==. Darkness has always been considered ==**invaluable** for a **soulful** life==, and the chance to witness the universe in the dark has inspired artists and philosophers since time began. In a world flooded with artificial light, how would **Vincent van Gogh** have given the world his *Starry Night*? Who knows what this vision of the night sky might inspire in each of us, in our children or grandchildren? 
    
        7 如今的社会越来越拥挤，越来越嘈杂，越来越快节奏，夜的黑暗能带给我们日益匮乏的独处和宁静。对于情感丰富的人而言，黑暗极为宝贵，而在时间的长廊中，黑暗中的宇宙给艺术家和哲学家们带来了无尽的灵感。假如文森特・凡・高生活在这样一个处处都是人造光的世界，他怎能留给我们《星空》这幅画作？而又有谁知道，画作中对夜空的遐想会在我们、我们下一代以及下下一代身上激发怎样的想象呢？
    
        8 Yet all over the world, our nights are getting brighter. In the United States and Western Europe, the amount of light in the sky increases an average of about six percent every year. Computer images of the United States at night, based on **NASA** photographs, show that what was a very dark country in the 1950s is now nearly covered with a **blanket** of light. Much of this light is wasted energy, which means wasted dollars. Those of us over 35 are perhaps among the last generation to have known truly dark nights. Even the lake where I was lucky to spend my summers during my childhood has seen its darkness **diminish**. 
    
        8 然而，全世界的夜空越来越明亮。在美国和西欧，夜空的亮度每年平均增加约6%。根据美国国家航空航天局的照片生成的计算机图像显示，二十世纪五十年代，美国夜空非常黑暗，如今却几乎笼罩在一片明亮的灯光下。这些灯光很大一部分是能源浪费，也意味着金钱浪费。超过35岁的人恐怕是见过真正黑夜的最后一代人。小时候，我有幸在漆黑一片的湖边度过夏天，但连笼罩那片湖的黑暗也在慢慢消失。
    
        9 It doesn't have to be this way. Light pollution is readily within our ability to solve, by using new lighting technologies and turning off some existing lights. Already, many cities and towns across North America and Europe are changing to LED streetlights, which offer dramatic possibilities for controlling wasted light. Other communities are finding success by simply turning off some of their public lighting after midnight. Even Paris, the "city of light," which already turns off its **monument** lighting after 1 a.m., will this summer start to require its shops, offices, and public buildings to turn off lights after 2 a.m. Though primarily designed to save energy, such reductions in the amount of light will also go far in addressing light pollution. But we will never truly address the problem of light pollution until we become aware of the irreplaceable value and beauty of the darkness we are losing. 
    
        9 情况并非不可改变。通过应用新的照明技术，关掉一部分现有的灯光，我们完全可以解决光污染这个问题。北美和欧洲许多城镇已经开始改用LED街灯，为控制灯光浪费提供了巨大的可能性。其他社区仅仅通过在午夜后关掉部分公共照明，就成功减少了浪费。甚至有“灯光之城”美誉的巴黎也已经于凌晨一点关掉历史建筑的照明，并从今年夏天开始，要求商店、办公室、公共建筑在凌晨两点以后关灯。虽然减少这类照明的主要目的是节约能源，但是这在解决光污染方面也将大有可为。然而，除非我们意识到我们正在失去的黑夜具有无可替代的价值和魅力，否则，我们永远无法真正解决光污染问题。
    
        10 This winter solstice, this longest night of the year, let us begin. 
    
        10 今年冬至，即今年黑夜最长的一天，让我们开始行动吧。
    
    ??? info "Reading 2: For this big fish, there's no place like home"
    
        1 Search "**salmon** crossing the road" on the Internet and you'll find dozens of videos of me and my **pals** **skittering** across wet streets and **highways** like **windup** toys on a mission. Cars slow and stop to let us cross, water **spraying** from our flicking tails as we navigate this long journey and **flop** back into the river on the other side. 
    
        1 在互联网上搜“三文鱼过马路”，可以找到几十段视频，拍的是我和我的伙伴们欢快地游过有水的街道和高速公路，那场面就像一堆发条玩具去执行命令一样。车辆会放慢车速，停下来让我们穿过。我们轻快地甩落尾巴上的水珠，啪嗒啪嗒扭动身子，长途跋涉，游回到马路对面的河流。
    
        2 The videos capture me after I've been away at sea for up to five years, navigating thousands of miles. To guide me on this journey, I use my unique inner **GPS** (which taps into the Earth's **magnetic** field) to get me closer to my birthplace. Then I begin to sniff out the specific river where I was born. I head home to lay eggs and, **alas**, usually to die — possibly after crossing a road or two. 
    
        2 当视频拍摄到我的时候，我已经游过几千英里，在海里呆了五年之久。我用体内独特的GPS导航（利用了地球的磁场）指引我的行程，慢慢游近我的出生地。然后，我通过嗅觉找到我出生的那条河，游回家产卵。呜呼！我常常在半路上丧命——可能才游过了一两条马路。
    
        3 When your local fish merchant or waiter distinguishes me as "wild," you should know that it is not a very strict **classification**. Of the eight living species of me, seven live in the Pacific. Pacific salmon are more closely tied to West Coast **rainbow trout** than to Atlantic salmon, while the Atlantic salmon is actually more closely related to a trout from the Northeast than to a salmon from the Pacific. 
    
        3 如果本地的鱼贩子或者餐厅服务员说我是“野生的”，你就应该知道所谓的“野生”是一个不太严格的分类。我有八个种类，其中七个生活在太平洋。太平洋三文鱼与西海岸的虹鳟的关系比与大西洋三文鱼的关系更密切，而大西洋三文鱼实际上与美国东北部的鳟鱼的关系比与太平洋三文鱼的关系更密切。
    
        4 More to the point, I am so ==**exquisitely** adjusted to the very river== I was born in that my size, my shape, and maybe even how I taste ==are specific to== — and determined by — that place. If I'm born ==far up the **Yukon River**,== for example, I will grow much larger and fatter than a salmon born in a small stream a mile away. After all, I will need enough strength and fat to swim home against the Yukon's strong ==current== and lay my eggs in its ==**rocky** bottom==. And fishermen know this, preferring to catch me precisely at the Yukon's ==mouth==, when ==my fat stores — the silky, rich **Omega-3**== that makes me delicious for eating and good for the heart — are in the best condition for a long swim up the river. 
    
        4 更重要的一点是，我已完全适应我出生的那条河流，以至于我的大小、体型，也许甚至连我的口感都是我出生的那条河特有的，也是由那条河决定的。比如，如果我的出生地在育空河上游，我就会长得比一英里以外的小溪里的三文鱼更大更肥，毕竟我需要足够的力气和脂肪迎着育空河的激流逆流而上，才能游回家，在布满岩石的河床产卵。渔夫们了解这一点，喜欢精准地守在育空河口捕获我，因为这个时候，我储存的脂肪——那丝滑、丰富的奥米伽3，使我不仅吃起来美味可口，而且还能强健心脏——正处于逆流而上的漫漫长路前的最佳状态。
    
        5 I've been a North American **staple** forever, in large part because of these unusual **spawning** habits. I'm the size of an ocean-grown fish, yet my return to local rivers has allowed fishermen to catch me without bothering to head out to sea the way they have to for **cod** and tuna. Such accessibility has **backfired** against me: While my Atlantic pals were once native to almost every **coastal** river northeast of **the Hudson**, they are now found in just eight lonely rivers in **Maine**, and thus protected. Word to the wise: If you see "wild Atlantic salmon" on a menu in North America, you're getting illegal fish, or false information. 
    
        5 长久以来，我是北美人的主食，主要是由于我与众不同的产卵习性。我与海鱼个头相近，而渔夫又能在我回家的路途中捕到我，无需像捕鳕鱼和金枪鱼那样出海捕捞。因为容易捕捞，我深受其害。我的大西洋伙伴原产于哈得孙河东北的几乎每一条沿海河流，而现在仅在缅因州的八条河流中才能找到它们的踪迹，并因此被列入了保护名录。给聪明的消费者一点忠告：假如你在北美餐馆的菜单上看到“野生大西洋三文鱼”几个字，那么要么你吃到了非法捕捞的三文鱼，要么得到了虚假信息。
    
        6 Even as they've become endangered in the wild, Atlantic salmon have however **thrived** in open-ocean net pens, giving me an advantage in the fish-farming business. Tuna and cod, by contrast, have been successfully farmed only recently and with difficulty. As a result, I've become the second-most-popular seafood in the United States, with 70 percent of the salmon that Americans eat coming from the farms along sheltered coasts. 
    
        6 虽然大西洋三文鱼在野生环境中濒临灭绝，但在公海的围栏中却能茁壮地生长，这让我在养鱼业中占了些许优势。相比之下，金枪鱼和鳕鱼是在历经重重困难后，才在近期成功养殖。于是，我便成了美国第二受欢迎的海鲜，美国人吃的70%的三文鱼来自有防护带的海边养殖场。
    
        7 That easy, relatively inexpensive **abundance** is a **blessing** for **diners** and cooks. My **fattiness** makes me **moist** even if you **overcook** me — that's why you see me at restaurants, weddings, and your neighbor's dinner party. Few fish lend themselves to such a variety of ways of cooking: I can be eaten smoked, **roasted** and grilled. And of course, I'm excellent raw. 
    
        7 因为我容易养殖，价格不太昂贵，数量充足，对食客和厨师而言，实乃一大幸事。即使烹饪时间过长，我的脂肪也能让我保持口感滑嫩，因此，你在餐馆里、婚宴上、邻居家的晚宴上都能见到我。很少有鱼类像我这样适合不同的烹饪方式，比如烟熏、烘烤、烧烤，当然生吃也是极佳的。
    
        8 On that last point, an unusual fish story: The Japanese considered eating raw salmon to be unacceptable until the 1990s. That's when the **Norwegians**, trying to find a way to sell their **surplus** of farmed salmon, persuaded Japanese consumers to **incorporate** my raw **flesh** into their **sushi**-eating customs. That's right: Your salmon-**avocado** roll is in fact the product of a smart **marketing** campaign of **Scandinavia**. 
    
        8 关于最后一点有一个不寻常的故事。二十世纪九十年代之前，日本人认为生吃三文鱼是无法接受的。当时，挪威人试图给养殖过多的三文鱼找到销售渠道，便劝说日本消费者将我的生肉放入他们传统的寿司中。没错，你吃的三文鱼牛油果卷实际上是斯堪的纳维亚人精明的营销活动的产物。
    
        9 Developments like this have done wonders for my popularity, but with unintended consequences. Some farmers looking to cut corners give me too many **antibiotics** that tend to leave me with environmental **toxins**. 
    
        9 这类新的吃法让我大受欢迎，然而也带来了意想不到的后果。有些渔民为了图省事，给我喂食太多抗生素，这会在我身上留下环境毒素。
    
        10 There's another risk I should mention. It's to the Pacific wild salmon. In 2017, about 300,000 Atlantic salmon escaped their pen in Washington State's **Puget Sound**. This caused concern that my Atlantic version might **overtake** my Pacific version, endangering my already **fragile** oceangoing population. When in 2018 a fisherman caught a live Atlantic salmon in Washington's **Skagit River** with a **belly** full of fish bones, the worry increased: Was my **domesticated** **breed** surviving out in the wild and threatening my wild population? 
    
        10 我应该提一下太平洋野生三文鱼面临的另一个风险。2017年，大约30万条大西洋三文鱼从华盛顿州皮吉特湾的养殖围栏逃脱，这让人们开始担心大西洋三文鱼的数量会超过太平洋三文鱼，使已经濒危的野生鱼群数量更少。2018年，一位渔民在华盛顿州的斯卡吉特河抓到一条满肚子鱼骨头的鲜活的大西洋三文鱼，人们因此更加担心，养殖的三文鱼如果在野生的环境存活了，是否会威胁到真正野生的三文鱼群？
    
        11 The risk led to Washington's decision to phase out Atlantic salmon farming by 2022. That's an important measure in my book. I'd like to stay wild, and take a **joyride** on the open road, for as long as I can. 
    
        11 这一风险使华盛顿下定决心，在2022年之前，逐步取缔大西洋三文鱼的养殖。在我看来，这可是一个重要的措施。我想继续做一条野生三文鱼，在开阔的水域自由地游来游去。

            Scientists are trying to find out how humor affects our brain, health, and quality of life. Dr. Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center in California, explains, "Humor, when it's actually funny, has various benefits. Laughter triggers the release of chemicals responsible for your happiness. The release of these chemicals in response to humor decreases stress, reduces pain, and in the process strengthens the immune system. The use of humor enables people to not only decrease negative emotions but distance themselves from misfortune and hardship." He also says that if you consider that positive emotions increase creative and flexible thinking, then it makes sense that humor can contribute to overcoming challenges.

            A few studies prove that theory, including a recent study published in an academic journal, where humor therapy was performed on 40 patients suffering kidney failure. The study, on patients who watched 30 minutes of comic shows twice a week over an eight-week period, showed that humor therapy can in fact reduce blood pressure. Dr. Gabriel, an associate professor of psychology at SUNY, University at Buffalo, concludes: "If we can feel more relaxed and less stressed, our bodies will be better at fighting diseases."

            **M:** Hmm, that's interesting. I've noticed that you always have great interest in lyrics when listening to a new song, instead of just the melody itself.

            **W:** Yes, I believe lyrics are the soul of a song.

            **M:** Are they? When I judge a song, my primary concern is always the melody — whether the music is pleasing to the ear. Lyrics just play a secondary role.

            **W:** Well, just think about those famous folk songs. The music itself is usually quite simple — sometimes just a single melody that is repeated over and over, without even a single key change. But the lyrics can be so touching that they almost make us cry.

            **M:** Just as a famous writer once said, if you want to move people, you need to tell them touching stories about individuals.

            **W:** Exactly! That is the power of lyrics. First of all, songwriters use lyrics to express themselves or to tell a story. For example, in a musical, the lyrics play a very important role in advancing a scene or the overall play. More importantly, lyrics can influence you, making you think about life or even bringing a change to your life.

            **M:** But there're also a lot of music forms like jazz, electronic, or classical music that don't need words to express their message.

            **W:** I agree that a song may be on your playlist if its melody sounds good. However, it's the lyrics that will make you want to listen to it again and again. Through the lyrics, you feel better connected to the song.

            **M:** Yes, there is something in what you say.

            There are many positive aspects of having a global language. Mutual understanding, great career opportunities, and reduced administrative costs are some of the advantages a global language would give to us. However, there are negative aspects as well.

            A global language might be more favorable to native speakers who take advantage of the possibility of thinking and working quickly in their mother tongue. Perhaps a global language will make people unwilling or unable to learn other languages and make other languages unnecessary. One of the risks of having one dominant language is that the chosen language may become very technical and "inadequate" for non-native speakers, e.g. the Inuit, who have many words for snow because they need it. They would probably be unable to express themselves properly if they had only one word for snow. Also, the introduction of a global language might lead to discrimination against minor languages and cultures. Losing one's language equals to losing one's identity. English is referred to as a "killer language," which means that it is learned at the cost of other languages, rather than additively.

            We need a global language for communication, politics, trade, and security, but at the same time we are worried about language death, the advantages native speakers will have, and all the disadvantages non-native speakers will face. Even if a global language might be important, different languages are of importance for their culture and for the development of their native speakers. Languages make the world more interesting and more alive.

            Questions:

            1. What might the Inuit think of English when it comes to describing snow?

            2. What does losing one's language mean?

            3. What's the speaker's attitude toward English as a global language?

            There is a famous quote by Ludwig Wittgenstein: "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." This perfectly summarizes the idea that the language you speak can change your worldview. This concept, the fundamental idea behind the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, has been around for a very long time. It's so tempting to think that our language can change the way we see the world. It could also be used to explain why people who speak other languages may seem different from us.

            In 1931, Sapir studied the language of a group of people living in Canada's Pacific Northwest Coast. He observed that instead of describing a falling stone as "the stone falls," the language uses a special verb to say "it stones down." Sapir claimed that this meant they had a different perception of the action and the object. Benjamin Lee Whorf, one of Sapir's students, expanded on this idea. He did a study of the Hopi people, a Native American tribe living in northeastern Arizona. Whorf determined that the Hopi language had no grammar to deal with time, and so the Hopi people had no concept of time. From this, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was born.

            However, not everyone was buying this. The linguist Ekkehart Malotki disagreed with Whorf completely in his book Hopi Time, in which he goes into great detail about Hopi words and expressions for time. Thus far, we haven't found a solid answer to the Sapir-Whorf debate ― whether language affects worldview or not.

            Questions:

            1. Which of the following is the basis of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis?

            2. What can we conclude about the people who say "it stones down", according to Sapir?

            3. What did Whorf claim about the Hopi people?

            4. What can be concluded from the passage?

            Recent research has investigated the connections between the Chinese language's increasing global popularity and China's growing cultural power.

            One fifth of the people on this planet speak Chinese. The Chinese language has the largest number of first-language speakers in the world, and more than 80 percent of China's population speaks Mandarin Chinese. The study of the Chinese language opens the way to important fields such as China's politics, economy, and history. The global demand for Chinese language education has kept pace with the country's economic development. According to a recent survey, 38 percent of human resources and financial directors in Europe — as well as Australia and New Zealand — expect Chinese to become the most valuable business language — other than English — in the near future.

            However, learning Chinese means learning about a culture and a people. To learn about the Chinese civilization well, it is essential to know its rich heritage of novels, short stories, poetry, drama, and, more recently, films. They reflect the values, the struggles, the joys, and the sadness of this great people. These works help you understand what is behind the language, what makes it powerful, and how it actually functions in society.

            Questions:

            1. What is the news report mainly about?

            2. Which of the following statements about Mandarin Chinese is true?

            **M:** Today we'll talk about persuasion. Hello, Susan! Thank you very much for being here with us today.

            **W:** I'm very pleased to be with you.

            **M:** My first question is: What is persuasion?

            **W:** To put it simply, persuasion is the ability to get what you want by using words.

            **M:** So how can we make ourselves more persuasive?

            **W:** By using some skills. Successful people all share a common ability to use language in ways that evoke vivid thoughts, feelings, and actions in their audience.

            **M:** Can you share with us some of the skills?

            **W:** OK. First of all, you should establish your credibility, showing confidence and authority through body language, intonation, etc.

            **M:** I see. If people trust you, they will accept what you say more readily.

            **W:** Yeah. The second skill is to use logic and reason to convince your audience.

            **M:** You mean facts like examples, data, and the findings of research?

            **W:** Exactly. And finally, the skill to appeal to the emotions of your audience.

            **M:** Should we use the skills together or focus on one of them?

            **W:** Deciding which of them to use is a matter of knowing your audience and purpose, as well as the right place and time.

            **M:** OK! And are the skills of persuasion something that we are born with or that we can learn through training?

            **W:** Some people are born with the talent of knowing what to say at precisely the right time, but the rest of us have to learn those skills to get what we want. And fortunately, they are learnable and teachable.

            **Questions:**

            1. What is the topic of the conversation?

            2. What is the common ability of successful people, according to the woman?

            Albert Einstein said, "If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales." Fairy tales are imaginative stories with rich visual and contextual elements that evoke emotions in children.

            In fairy tales, it's always clear that this isn't the real world. The characters might be unfamiliar to the children but the problems and the feelings that are dealt with are themselves often very true to life. Fairy tales give children a way to understand some of the really confusing and difficult feelings that they can't yet express for themselves. Besides, the simple, good-versus-bad storyline of fairy tales and the characters within them help children deal with uncertainty. They allow kids to explore the idea that life isn't always easy and that things can go wrong. Listening to fairy tales also taps into the ability to use our imagination. Fairy tales inspire and build on children's imagination, taking them to new heights.

            At the same time, as the "good" characters are usually rewarded at the end, it's a way of reinforcing positively the importance of being kind, thoughtful, and true. This desire to learn and experience more leads children to pick up books and gain more narrative experiences to inspire their journeys in life.

            Questions:

            1. What does the quote from Albert Einstein imply?

            2. How can children benefit from reading fairy tales?

            My friend used to commute to work daily on a train. After getting off the train, he always walked a short distance to his office building. Every morning, he passed an old man who was always at the same spot with a cup in hand, hoping to get a bit of change from passersby. For most people, this person was someone to be ignored as if he didn't exist. But my friend would always say good morning to him and bid him a good day. The old man would smile back, say good morning, and remain there until all the commuters had gone on their way.

            Occasionally, my friend would drop a dollar or two in the old man's cup on his way to work as the old man said hello. This went on for several years until one day, on his last day at work before retirement, my friend stopped for a few minutes to talk with the old man. He told the man that he would no longer be passing by because this was his last day at work. The old man took his hand and shook it warmly, saying that he had always looked forward to seeing my friend pass by, but not because he dropped a few dollars in his cup. He said he would miss my friend because he was one of the few people out of thousands who ever said hello when passing by. And my friend was the only one who ever bid him a good day. The old man also said that my friend's warm words always brightened his day and helped him to continue on, despite being ignored by thousands of others who saw him daily.

			CGTN's second International Nature Photography Contest has closed. It received hundreds of works from photographers who love nature. Eventually, six works were selected for their amazing ==interpretations== of Mother Nature.

            The first prize went to Love Story of Winter by Jiang Tieqi, which illustrates the winter in a very ==poetic== way. In this work, a bunch of ==mallards（mallard，n. 绿头鸭）== break the silence of winter. As a professor of Art and Design, Jiang has his own artistic style. His photos are like Chinese paintings in which birds, rivers, and ==mist（n. 薄雾）== convey a poetic feeling.

            The second prize-winning photos were Sea After Sunset and Where Is My Nectar. Sea After Sunset creates a deep and ==mysterious== feel of the sunset. The photo was taken by Lin Jianlong on Weizhou Island, the largest island in Guangxi. Where Is My Nectar was taken by Rahul Lakhmani from India. In this work, there is a sense of joy and relief. "I believe nature is the only solution to all our life problems, or at least reducing our daily life stress," says Lakhmani.

            The winners will receive an award from CGTN and a certificate in the coming weeks.

            The contest is intended to raise awareness of the need to care about and protect Mother Nature.

			For human beings, nature has always been a source of inspiration, and a place to reflect and heal. Many studies have highlighted the countless ways that simply being in nature will benefit us mentally and physically. In a classic study performed in a Pennsylvania hospital, patients who had a window view of trees recovered from surgery much faster than those who had only a brick wall to look at. The patients who could see nature from their window also received fewer negative evaluations（n. 评价） from nurses and took fewer ==painkillers==. A recent study also shows that adults can reduce their blood pressure by simply spending 30 minutes or more a week walking in a park.

            I remember one of the most difficult times in my life when I would go daily into the forest near our home and take the family dog for a long walk. The exercise, combined with the beautiful scenery, was my daily source of comfort. The ancient redwoods（n. 红杉） reminded me of the many winter storms they've ==weathered== during their lifetime. Seeing an eagle flying above helped me to think of the need for a broader view of my own circumstances. Looking at the grass, ants, and ==butterflies== reminded me that life is constantly ==evolving== and adapting over time. Nature ==rejuvenated（rejuvenate，vt. 使···恢复活力）== me and gave me a place to reflect, and to recover from the stress of the personal changes I was going through.

			Giant pandas make their homes in the ==mountainous（a. 多山的）== bamboo forests of western China. With their cute appearance, they may be among the most beloved animals in the world. Long lines are known to ==form== at American zoos to see a panda.

            However, the numbers of giant pandas experienced a decline in the past. From the 1970s to the 1980s, the giant pandas were affected by a severe habitat loss. This was a major threat to them because the bamboo, their main food source, is so low in ==nutrients== that they have to cover a lot of land to find and eat enough of it.

            In the middle of the 1970s, the number of giant pandas was 2,459. By 1988 it had dropped to 1,114. The giant panda was listed as an endangered species in 1984.

            Chinese people have made significant efforts to save the panda from extinction. They established more panda ==reserves== and increased the area of the natural reserves. Panda numbers gradually began to recover, hitting 1,596 in 2003 and 1,864 in 2013. In 2016, the giant panda was removed from the list of endangered species.

            The panda is also an umbrella species. To protect them, the government must protect their forests, which benefits the farmers next to the panda reserves. For example, forests store and clean fresh water and supply wood and many useful plants. The pandas themselves hold enormous cultural and economic value. For example, ==tourism== grew rapidly, rising by 500 times from 1980 to 2010.

            The protection of the giant panda provides a promising example of how conservation efforts can pay off, which could be applied to other endangered species.

			Among the ==virtues（virtue，n. 优点）== of bees, what you may not be aware of is their ability to ==detect bombs==.

            As bees can pick up the smell of bombs with their ==antennae（antenna，n. 触角）==, researchers have spent years ==perfecting== how to use bees to find the exact location of ==landmines（landmine，n. 地雷）==.

            Landmines buried during wars that happened decades ago continue to present a huge threat in many parts of the world.

            Recently, a team of researchers have tried training bees to find landmines. They achieved this by getting the bees to associate the smell of bombs with food. In a landmine field, the trained bees tend to get close to places where landmines are buried, in the hope of finding food.

            In recent years, researchers have developed systems able to follow insects in the wild. Such machines could one day monitor ==pollinators（pollinator，n. 传粉昆虫）==. These insects, including bees, are essential to the health of ==crops== and ecosystems, but their numbers have been declining lately, largely due to pollution.

            Imagine insects and machines working together — a fun idea, and potentially good for the planet.

			Copying nature is an old idea. ==Inventors== have ==modeled machines== after animals throughout the centuries. Although the easiest way may be the direct ==imitation（n. 模仿）== of nature, this is often difficult if not impossible. ==Bionics== researchers have found that it is more helpful to understand the principles of how things work in nature.  

            One question of interest to bionics is how a living system makes use of information. Humans can recognize how a new situation is somehow similar to a situation experienced before. An important element in human action is the ability to recognize patterns, which is significant for bionics. One way to design a machine capable of recognizing patterns is to use learning processes. Such machines have been developed. They learn by establishing connections among a large number of ==alternative routes==.

            Another main field of bionics research is energy transformation. In the living world, energy is stored in the form of ==chemical compounds（compound，n. 化合物）==; its use is always accompanied by chemical reactions. For example, solar energy is stored by ==plants== by means of complex chemical processes. The light produced by certain mushrooms and fish is of chemical origin. In every case, the energy transformation is much more efficient compared with ==thermal（a. 热的；热量的）== engines.

            Understanding the principles of these transformations makes it possible for bionics researchers to design artificial-energy machines.

            Questions:

            1. Which of the following is true of the relationship between nature and bionics?

            2. How do machines recognize patterns?

			Whenever I go to the mountains or the coast, I seem to be ready to be more kind and generous to those around me. Now some new studies may explain why that is.

            In a series of experiments, researchers studied the potential impact of nature on the willingness to be generous and trusting toward others. In one experiment, the researchers exposed participants to nature scenes and then observed how participants behaved when playing two games, one measuring generosity and the other measuring trust. They found that participants who were exposed to more beautiful nature scenes acted more generously and were more trusting in the games than those who saw less beautiful scenes.

            In another experiment, the participants filled out a survey about their emotions while sitting at a table where more or less beautiful plants were placed. Afterward, the participants were told that the experiment was over and they could leave, but if they wanted to, they could volunteer to make paper ==cranes（crane，n. 鹤）== for a relief effort program. The number of cranes they made was used as a measure of their willingness to help.

            Results showed that the ==presence== of more beautiful plants significantly increased the number of cranes made by participants, and that this increase, again, resulted from positive emotions. The researchers concluded that experiencing the beauty of nature increases positive emotions. This is probably because nature inspires in them ==awe==, a feeling similar to wonder, with the sense of being part of something bigger than oneself, which then leads to kind behaviors.

            Questions:

            1. Why were the participants in the first experiment asked to play games?

            2. Which of the following affected the mood of the participants in the second experiment?
